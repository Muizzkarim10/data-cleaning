Fall Green Manure MixCover Crop Seed,"This ready-made mix is comprised of winter rye, field peas, ryegrass, crimson clover, and hairy vetch. Vigorous late-summer growth provides winter erosion control. The peas, clover, and ryegrass will winter kill to provide organic matter and soil cover. The hairy vetch and winter rye will regrow in the spring to provide nutrients for crops to utilize. Because the seeds of this mix vary in weight and size, it is best seeded with a grain drill.

Hairy VetchOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sow spring to late summer with or without grain, grass, or field peas. When sown in late summer, spring regrowth is vigorous and nitrogen producing for tilling in before planting the spring garden crops. Typical nitrogen produced is 110 lbs./acre.

It will do well in soils too acidic for many clovers and alfalfas. May have some allelopathic properties, so it is best to allow 2-3 weeks between incorporating and seeding of small-seeded crops. This selected hardy strain is widely adapted and withstands all but severe winters if sown in late summer or fall. Sow at 1 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (40 lb./acre) with rye or oats.

Buckwheat (Common)Organic Cover Crop Seed,"Buckwheat is widely grown as a grain crop, bee pasture, soil improving cover crop and as wildlife cover. It is a warm season grain which grows rapidly during the summer and several crops per year may be had with proper management. This rapid and dense growth chokes out weeds and is used in crop-free fields in rotation with vegetables. Buckwheat is often grown to attract beneficial insects and as pasture for honey bees. Sow in late May through July and till in about a month later, when flowering has begun. For grain harvest, sow 3 months before fall frost. Harvest after killing frost.

Large plant with big leaves makes it an ideal grazing crop. Red clover may be the best choice for frost seeding; it is extremely cold hardy and does well in most soils and growing conditions. it does, like most clovers, perform poorly in hot weather unless seeded into a crop canopy. Incorporate fully for best results. Mammoth Red clover will fix between 70-110 lbs. nitrogen per acre. The long taproots loosen soils and mine phosphorus and other nutrients from deep in the soil.

Sow in spring to summer at 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (15 lb./acre) as an annual, or let grow the next year over 6 ft. tall. Should be grown with 1½ to 2 bushels of oats as a ""nurse"" crop. Sweet clover is slow to establish the first year and may have some winter kill without adequate snow cover. Second year growth is tremendous. Will fix as much nitrogen as alfalfa and doesn't require an acid soil. Can produce as much as 170 lb. of nitrogen per acre although 100 lb. per acre is closer to the average.

Sweet CloverOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sweet clover can grow nearly anywhere, with as little as 16 inches of rainfall per year. It has deep tap roots that mine soil nutrients and water from deep within the soil. It is better than many of the other clovers for nutrient recycling and appears to have a greater capacity to extract potassium, phosphorus and other soil nutrients from insoluble minerals. Sow in spring to summer at 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (15 lb./acre) as an annual, or let grow the next year over 6 ft. tall. Should be grown with 1½ to 2 bushels of oats as a ""nurse"" crop. Sweet clover is slow to establish the first year and may have some winter kill without adequate snow cover. Second year growth is tremendous. Will fix as much nitrogen as alfalfa and doesn't require an acid soil. Can produce as much as 170 lb. of nitrogen per acre although 100 lb. per acre is closer to the average. Excellent conditioner for poor and thin soils. Mostly yellow with some white flowers. Pre-inoculated with OMRI listed Nitragin Gold.

It is an excellent choice for underseeding as it grows well in the shade of other crops. Easier to incorporate in the spring than Hairy Vetch. Do not use for frost seeding as it won't handle the cold nearly as well as red clover. Crimson clover will not re-grow after close grazing or mowing once flowering has begun.

Hairy VetchOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sow spring to late summer with or without grain, grass, or field peas. When sown in late summer, spring regrowth is vigorous and nitrogen producing for tilling in before planting the spring garden crops. Typical nitrogen produced is 110 lbs./acre. This rapid spring growth also makes it a good weed suppressant. Hairy vetch prefers well-drained soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0, and will do poorly in clay or wet fields. It will do well in soils too acidic for many clovers and alfalfas. May have some allelopathic properties, so it is best to allow 2-3 weeks between incorporating and seeding of small-seeded crops. This selected hardy strain is widely adapted and withstands all but severe winters if sown in late summer or fall. Sow at 1 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (40 lb./acre) with rye or oats.
