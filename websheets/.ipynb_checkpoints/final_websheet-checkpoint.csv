	Description

Monarch larvae feed exclusively on Milkweed plants. including Butterfly Milkweed (Asclepias Tuberosa) that has been recommended by the North American Butterfly Association.

One of the factors that is causing this decrease is the loss of the Monarch caterpillars’ food plant, namely, milkweeds. This species of milkweed does not spread by runners like common milkweed therefore it is not invasive. Native to North America. Fun for kids and adults alike!

A favorite of the humminbird moth and sphinx moths.

Indescribably fragrant, Moonflower is one of the joys of the night garden, and this 6-foot vine is particularly effective on the patio, twining up the porch railings, or set under windows, where the fragrance can be appreciated indoors and out.
An easy, carefree vine, Moonflower can be started ahead indoors or direct-sown when the soil is warm in any sunny garden spot. The blooms arise all summer and into fall. Magnificent!

"Clover,  Crimson","
				
	Description

Pasture and hay crop. Crimson clover is excellent for grazing and haying. It will regrow if grazed or mowed no lower than 3 or 4 inches before the early bud stage. Mixing with grass reduces its relatively low bloat risk even further. Timely mowing four to six weeks before bloom improves growth, reduces lodging and will cause more uniform flowering and seed ripening on highly fertile.
With its rapid, robust growth, crimson clover provides early spring nitrogen for full-season crops. Rapid fall growth, or summer growth in cool areas, also makes it a top choice for short-rotation niches as a weed suppressing green manure. Popular as a staple forage, crimson clover is gaining increased recognition as a versatile summer-annual cover in colder regions. Its spectacular beauty when flowering keeps it visible even in a mix with other flowering legumes.
Since those early days of food plot experimentation, crimson clover has become one of the most popular annual clovers planted for deer. It is highly preferred by deer as it is an easily digestible, nutritious cool season food plot crop that can withstand heavy, continuous grazing.
Can be mixed with rye and other cereals, vetches, annual ryegrass, red clover.

,"Elephant Garlic bulblets will be available for sale in September 2024.

Elephant garlic, or oriental garlic, is halfway between garlic and leek. It has very large bulbs, 7 to 10 cm long and weighing up to 400 g, made up of 4 to 6 large cloves with a milder flavor than ordinary garlic. Its stems, leaves and flowers, however, resemble leeks in every way.

Where and when to plant elephant garlic cloves?

Elephant garlic enjoys all types of soil, as long as they are well aerated and drained, and amended the season before planting, as well as sunny exposures. In compact, damp soils, cultivate in raised beds 10 to 15 cm high to facilitate water drainage.

Elephant garlic is planted in autumn, from September to November.

How to plant elephant garlic cloves?

To plant garlic cloves correctly, and obtain a good harvest:


	make a furrow, or draw a line, on either side of the cultivation line, spacing each line 30 cm apart;
	plant the cloves, pointing upwards, 5 cm deep in well-drained soil, every 10 to 15 cm.


Care and maintenance

After planting, this garlic requires very little maintenance. Hoe the plant a few times during the growing season to eliminate weeds, and cut off the flower stalks in June to encourage bulb development.

Water only if the soil is too dry, during planting and bulb formation. Garlic elephant plants can be mulched in dry periods. Avoid mulching in humid regions, however, as excess water causes the bulbs to rot.

When and how to harvest garlic?

All parts of elephant garlic can be eaten, and it can be harvested at any stage of maturity. Garlic can be harvested from May to August.

Leaves: May to June

Elephant garlic leaves can be harvested as and when needed, and eaten in the same way as leeks. However, such harvesting considerably limits bulb development.

The flower stalk: in June

Around June, elephant garlic produces a long flower stalk. It can be harvested before the inflorescence appears and, like leeks, eaten raw or steamed.

Mature bulbs: July to August

Mature bulbs are harvested when the top half of the leaves have dried. Harvest elephant garlic plants in dry weather, leaving them to dry out on the ground for a few days. If rain or excessive heat is forecast in the days following harvest, spread them out in a protected area before storing.

How to store elephant garlic bulbs

For long-lasting storage, keep garlic heads well dried, away from light and in a cool, well-ventilated room. In bunches, nets or crates, garlic can be stored in a variety of ways.

Elephant garlic can be stored for 3 to 6 months.

Where and when to plant garlic cloves?

Garlic appreciates all types of soil, provided they are well aerated and drained, and amended the season before planting, as well as sunny exposures. In compact, damp soils, cultivate on raised beds 10 to 15 cm high to facilitate water drainage.

Autumn garlic is planted from September to November.

How to plant garlic cloves?

To plant garlic cloves correctly and obtain a good harvest, you need to


	choose healthy cloves of the right size;
	draw a furrow or a line on either side of the cultivation line, spacing each line 30 cmapart;
	plant the cloves, pointing upwards, 5 cm deep in well-drained soil, every 10 to 15 cm.


Garlic care

After planting, garlic requires very little maintenance, and only a few hoeings are needed to eliminate weeds.

Water only if the soil is too dry, during planting and bulb formation. Garlic plants can be mulched in dry periods, but this should be avoided in humid regions, as excess water causes the bulbs to rot.

When and how to harvest garlic?

All parts of the garlic plant can be eaten, and it can be harvested at all stages of maturity: young plants, fresh bulbs and mature bulbs. Autumn garlic harvests run from April to July.

Carnation: from April onwards

Garlic is harvested as needed, before the bulb has formed, by plucking from the base. It's eaten like chives, and makes a wonderful accompaniment to omelettes, salads, pestos and more. For carnation production, the pods can be planted every 3 or 5 cm on the row.

Fresh or ""green"" bulbs: in May

Fresh young bulbs are full of water and have a sweeter taste than mature bulbs. They can be harvested as needed.

Mature bulbs: June to July

Mature bulbs, intended for storage, are harvested when the upper half of the leaves are dry. If the weather is dry, uproot the garlic plants and leave them to dry out on the ground for a few days. If rain or too much heat is forecast for the days following harvest, spread them out in a protected area before storing.

Garlic bulb storage

,"Discover the chayote, Sechium edule, also known as christophine, chouchou or sousou, a unique fruiting vegetable. This tuberous perennial, a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, develops immense stems several meters long and fitted with tendrils. In late summer, around September or October, the chayote, or christophine, produces large green vegetables, the size and shape of a large pear, with a delicate flavor halfway between potato and zucchini.
This tropical plant, widespread in Réunion, Guadeloupe and all the West Indies, can be grown in temperate climates, provided it gets enough sun and warmth.
How to grow chayote
Chayote cultivation begins in early spring, indoors under cover, around February or March:

fill a large pot, about 20 cm in diameter, with a mixture of compost and moistened garden soil;
plant the whole fruit flat, so that it is buried two-thirds of the way up;
insert a stake at least 1 m high;
place the pot in a warm, bright spot in the house;
keep the soil moist, but not soggy.

Install this christophine in the vegetable garden, in a sheltered, well-exposed spot, when frosts are no longer a concern and the soil is sufficiently warm. Provide a sturdy support system such as a pergola or trellis.
Water regularly, especially during dry spells.
Pull the plant back at the end of the season and carefully protect the stump from winter frosts with thick mulch.
How to plant a chayote in the ground?
Around April or May, your chayote plant is starting to become quite vigorous, and night frosts are no longer a threat. It's time to plant it in the garden, in soil that has been worked beforehand:

dig a hole at least 30 cm deep ;
add a good handful of compost or well-decomposed manure;
install a sturdy support system close to the hole: pergola, trellis, tree, metal structure, etc.
remove the chayote plant and place it carefully in the hole;
fill in with the removed soil and press lightly;
water abundantly;
mulch generously.

Chayotes: when to harvest? 
Christophines can be stored in different ways:

whole, in a cool, well-ventilated place such as a cellar, they will keep for several months;
blanched or cooked, they can be kept for up to a year in the freezer;
cooked and canned, in sterilized jars;
lacto-fermented in brine, they can be kept for several months.

The Celtiane potato; the Breton firm-fleshed, early to semi-early (85 days).
Famous for its firm flesh and thin skin, the Celtiane offers an abundance of beautiful, elongated tubers with very thin skin and yellow flesh. The result of a cross between the Amandine and Eden varieties, this potato has inherited the culinary qualities of the former and the productivity of the latter.
With its firm, flavorful flesh and good cooking properties, this potato is ideal for boiling or steaming to accompany raclette or salads.
Available in nets of 25 plants, 1.5 kg.
Growing Celtiane potatoes
Grow potatoes in a sunny spot in the vegetable garden, as in the shade the foliage withers and the harvest is small. Choose light, easy-to-work, deep soil. If necessary, lighten heavy soils by adding mature compost or potting soil, then fertilize with well-decomposed manure before planting.
Plant potatoes when the soil is sufficiently warm (above 7°C) and frosts are no longer a threat, from March to June, depending on the climate. Late frosts can cause young shoots to wither.
Water only during dry spells, without wetting the foliage.
How do I germinate Celtiane potatoes?
Sprout potato tubers, or seed potatoes, 1 month before the planned planting date to ensure a good start to the crop.
Set up the potato plants in ideal conditions for them to develop nice, stubby sprouts:

spread the tubers out in crates or trays, without overlapping them, with the ""eyes"", the points from which the sprouts will emerge, facing upwards;
keep them in this position, if necessary, using folded sheets of newspaper;
keep the racks in a bright, cool but frost-free place, between 7 and 15°C. Light is essential for thick, green sprouts.

At planting time, potatoes should have stocky sprouts of 1 to 1.5 cm.
How to plant Celtiane potatoes?
Plant potatoes in rows 60-70 cm apart:


dig a furrow about 15 cm deep in each row, using a furrow cutter or hoe;


place a tuber every 30 to 40 cm, sprout side up, in the furrow;


Carefully cover them by a few centimetres, taking care not to damage the sprouts.


The soil set aside during furrow formation will be brought back around the potato plants as they grow, during ridging.
To improve potato yields :

ridge potato plants when they reach 15 to 20 cm in height;
mulch generously at the base of potato plants;
hoe, if necessary, to limit weed growth, facilitate water penetration into the soil, and reconstitute ridges;
water during dry spells, without wetting the foliage.

When to harvest Celtiane potatoes?

store them in silos, crates or crates, in a frost-free, dark place;
check your harvest regularly and remove tubers showing signs of mould.

Potato pests and diseases
Like tomatoes, potatoes are susceptible to mildew. This disease thrives in hot, humid conditions, and once it appears, it's almost impossible to get rid of. Take preventive action to avoid infestation:

water only in dry weather and do not wet foliage ;
mulch crops;
space plants sufficiently apart to ensure good aeration.

Certain insects, such as Colorado beetles, flea beetles and aphids, can attack potato foliage and cause serious damage. Monitor crops regularly to prevent infestation.
Potatoes can also be affected by internal blackening. This disorder is characterized by bluish-gray spots under the skin, varying in diameter. They can progress deep into the flesh of the tuber, and in the most serious cases result in black spots. Blackening develops when tubers have a high dry matter content and have been subjected to shock or pressure.",

Set up the potato plants in ideal conditions for them to develop nice, stubby sprouts:

spread the tubers out in crates or trays, without overlapping them, with the ""eyes"", the points from which the sprouts will emerge, facing upwards;
keep them in this position, if necessary, using folded sheets of newspaper;
keep the racks in a bright, cool but frost-free place, between 7 and 15°C. Light is essential for thick, green sprouts.

At planting time, potatoes should have stocky sprouts of 1 to 1.5 cm.
How to plant Linzer Delikatess potatoes?
Plant potatoes in rows 60-70 cm apart:


dig a furrow about 15 cm deep in each row, using a furrow cutter or hoe;


place a tuber every 30 to 40 cm, sprout side up, in the furrow;


Carefully cover them by a few centimetres, taking care not to damage the sprouts.


The soil set aside during furrow formation will be brought back around the potato plants as they grow, during ridging.
To improve potato yields :

ridge potato plants when they reach 15 to 20 cm in height;
mulch generously at the base of potato plants;
hoe, if necessary, to limit weed growth, facilitate water penetration into the soil, and reconstitute ridges;
water during dry spells, without wetting the foliage.

When to harvest Linzer Delikatess potatoes?
The firm-fleshed Linzer Delikatess potato reveals its full flavour when harvested around June, 75 days after planting. They can also be harvested around 100 days after planting for consumption or storage.
How do I store Linzer Delikatess potatoes?
After harvesting, dry potatoes thoroughly before storing:

spread them out on a sheet or in crates;
leave them in a ventilated place, sheltered from light and humidity, for a few days;
store them in silos, crates or crates, in a frost-free, dark place;
check your harvest regularly and remove tubers showing signs of mould.

Potato pests and diseases
Like tomatoes, potatoes are susceptible to mildew. This disease thrives in hot, humid conditions, and once it appears, it's almost impossible to get rid of. Take preventive action to avoid infestation:

water only in dry weather and do not wet foliage ;
mulch crops;
space plants sufficiently apart to ensure good aeration.

Certain insects, such as Colorado beetles, flea beetles and aphids, can attack potato foliage and cause considerable damage. Monitor crops regularly to prevent infestation.
Potatoes can also be affected by internal blackening. This disorder is characterized by bluish-gray spots under the skin, varying in diameter. They can progress deep into the flesh of the tuber, and in the most serious cases result in black spots. Blackening develops when tubers have a high dry matter content and have been subjected to shock or pressure.",

,"Crocus sativus bulbs will be available for sale again at the end of June 2024.

Crocus sativus, the only species capable of producing saffron, is a 15 cm-tall bulbous plant whose violet flowers provide 3 yellow stamens and 3 red stigmas. Saffron bulbs of sizes 8-9 (8-9 cm circumference), 9-11 (9-11 cm circumference) and 11-13 (11-13 cm circumference) produce flowers from the first year.

Organic French saffron since the 15th century. Crocus sativus bulbs are propagated and harvested in France by Safranière du Luberon (84).

What is Crocus sativus saffron?

Saffron, also known as ""Red Gold"", has been prized for its medicinal properties since Antiquity and Ancient Greece, and is a staple of Oriental and Mediterranean cuisine.

To produce 1 gram of saffron, you need between 150 and 200 flowers! Even if you need very little of this spice to flavor a dish, it's expensive because of the labor required to harvest the stigmas (the spicy part of the flower).

This lucrative market encourages many unscrupulous dealers to resell ""doctored"" saffron powder at prices ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per kilo.

Its magnificent flowers feature 6 violet tepals (parts of the floral envelope whose sepals and petals are indistinguishable), 3 yellow stamens and 3 reddish-brown stigmas.

Growing saffron yourself is within the reach of all gardeners: beginners, experienced or confirmed. In a window box or in the ground, a good exposure to the sun and a few simple recommendations are all you need to enjoy this spice with its honeyed taste and metallic notes.

When to plant crocus sativus bulbs?

The appearance of sprouts on Crocus sativus in no way alters their quality, and poses no problem when planting them.

From late June to mid-September, in soil or pots, at a depth of 15 to 25 cm, plant organic saffron crocus bulbs, size 9-11, point upwards, spaced 8 to 12 cm apart (preferably in drained soil rich in organic matter).

Do not water the plants. Saffron bulbs do not tolerate heat and humidity, and risk rotting.

Every 2-3 years, remove bulbs and replant elsewhere in the garden. Crocus sativus bulbs are very greedy and deplete the soil's resources. This weakening of the soil is conducive to the development of disease and other pathogens.

How to propagate saffron bulbs?

The Crocus sativus species multiplies. From one year to the next, the bulbs will produce bulblets which, once developed, will in turn produce saffron flowers!

Don't throw away pots and plants! From March to September, saffron bulbs are in a state of dormancy, and will restart their life cycles in autumn.

In autumn, as soon as temperatures start to drop, saffron stems start to grow. Water only if there's no rain. If you're short of water, when the weeds reach a sufficient height (5 to 10 cm) water the plant and the flowers will follow. Remember to pull out weeds so that the saffron plant grows comfortably in the soil.

How to harvest saffron pistils?

In October, gently remove the saffron flowers early in the morning, once the dew has evaporated and before the petals open. Once harvested and opened, the flowers are pruned. This operation, which must be carried out on the day of harvest, consists of extracting the 3 red stigmas (spices). They can be picked by hand or with tweezers.

How to dry saffron pistils?

Once the flowers have been pruned, place the stigmas in a stainless steel sieve (e.g. a flour sieve). For optimum drying without altering the quality of the saffron, place the sieve with the pistils in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes at 50°C. To check that the spice is dry, weigh the stigmas before and after drying. They should lose 4 to 5 times their weight.

It's important to dry the flower stigmas directly after harvesting.

Once dried, store saffron (dried stigmas) in an airtight glass jar, away from light. To enjoy its full flavor, let the organic saffron spice mature for 3 months before eating.

Where do Crocus sativus saffron bulbs come from?

Crocus Sativus bulbs, caliber 9-11, are propagated in southeastern France by Safranière du Luberon. The strains of these bulbs come from the Conservatoire du Safranério, which preserves the biodiversity of saffron and the species by conserving its strains, with the help of members who propagate them according to strict specifications. Open to all, the Safranério Conservatory provides traceability for organic saffron plantations and guarantees the parentage of Crocus sativus bulbs.",

draw a furrow, or draw a line, on either side of the cultivation line, spacing each line 25 to 30 cm apart;
plant the bulbs, pointing upwards, 5 cm deep in well-drained soil, every 15 to 20 cm.

Cultivating shallots
After planting, shallots require very little maintenance, and only a few hoeings are needed to eliminate weeds.
Water only if the soil is too dry, during planting and bulb formation. If humidity is excessive during cultivation, remove the soil around the bulbs with a hoe.
When and how to harvest shallots? 
Shallots are harvested from July to August, when the foliage begins to turn yellow in dry weather. Pull up the shallot plants and leave them to dry out on the ground for a few days. If rain or too much heat is forecast in the days following harvest, spread them out in a protected area before storing.
Storing shallot bulbs
For long storage, keep shallots well dried, away from light and in a cool, well-ventilated room. Jersey shallots can be stored in crates or racks for 8 to 12 months.
Shallots in the vegetable garden
Avoid planting shallots, or other plants of the same family (leeks, garlic, onions, etc.), in the same place for at least 4 to 5 years.
Companion plants: good and bad associations with shallots
In the vegetable garden, shallots like to be close to :

beet ;
carrot ;
potato;
tomatoes.

It should stay away from :

broad bean ;
beans ;
peas.

Shallot diseases and pests

To avoid these diseases, take all the necessary measures to limit humidity accumulation as much as possible - dethatching, sunny exposure, sufficient spacing, etc. - to avoid these diseases.
Like onions, shallots can be affected by onion maggot.",

,"Sorghum, which is highly resistant to drought, is an annual plant used for the nutritional qualities of its ""popping"" grains or for making syrups. This variety grows to almost 3 meters in height and bears orange-brown panicles.

Traditionally in Africa, the sheaths of its leaves, often colored red, are used as a dye plant thanks to their anthocyanin content.

Sorghum characteristics

Nerum Boer sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, is a variety discovered in southern Sudan. Today, this cereal is grown all over the world, mainly as fodder for livestock. The nutrient-rich grains can also be eaten as flour or puffs, and the sweet stalks as syrup. In Africa, the red leaves are used as dyes. In the vegetable garden, sorghum is useful for soil restructuring and end-of-season mulching. This green fertilizer is also an excellent source of biomass. What's more, its tall stalks can be used as natural stakes in combined crops.

Sorghum grows up to 3 m tall and produces orange-brown panicles. Highly drought-resistant, this annual plant thrives in warm, humus-rich, deep soil.

Sorghum seedlings

Sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, can be sown from April to June in full sun and in well-warmed soil. This cereal is grown in a similar way to maize, with an island layout to encourage pollination and better grain development.

Sow lightly, directly in place, in rows 15 cm apart. Cover the seeds with 1 to 2 cm of fine soil and keep the seedbed moist until emergence. Seeds generally germinate in 4 to 10 days at temperatures between 18 and 32°C. Once the grass has emerged, thin out to leave one plant every 10 to 20 cm.

In a home garden, it is also possible to sow in pots or boxes, in 3-seed stacks, then transplant into the ground at the stage of 4 to 5 true leaves, at 10 to 20 cm intervals in all directions.

Sorghum needs a lot of heat to ripen and requires little water. As it is not usually susceptible to lodging, support is not desirable.

Sorghum harvest

Sorghum is harvested between September and October, once the seeds are hard and well-formed. The plants should start to dry out and turn yellow. Pull them up - or cut them off at the base. Hang them upside down in a dry, well-ventilated place to complete the drying of the seeds. Once the sorghum plants and seeds are dry, extract the seeds from the panicles by rubbing them between your hands or on a sieve. Sort the harvest by sieving or winnowing, then store the perfectly dry seeds in an airtight container for optimum preservation.

Between Barbu du Tarn, Rouge de Bordeaux, Touselle de Nîmes, Saissette de Provence, etc., the varieties have evolved together over many years to offer today, following natural hybridization, this homogenized blend.

In order to obtain a better genetic mix, we recommend sowing the whole bag at once.

IMPORTANT: to prevent the risk of wheat decay, we recommend treating seeds before sowing with a 4% solution of acetic acid (8% concentrated white vinegar, diluted 50% in water). Apply 1.7 l per 100 kg of seed, or 2 ml per 120 g sachet. Dry seeds quickly after application. Caution: underdosing will be ineffective, and overdosing may limit germination.",

,"This fast-growing flax plant produces a multitude of small, delicate blue flowers. An excellent green manure, it is also cultivated for its fiber (fabric, insulation material, etc.) and its oil seeds, which are used as a condiment or oil.

In association with potato plants, tomatoes or eggplants, cultivated blue flax is an excellent beetle repellent.

Characteristics of cultivated blue flax

Cultivated blue flax, Linum usitatissimum, is a very old annual species. For thousands of years, the peoples of Central Asia, the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Gauls have fostered the development of a species of flax called usitatissimum. The first fiber, 36,000 years old, was found in the Dzudzuana cave in Georgia.

This slender-stemmed plant grows from 80 to 120 cm tall. It has elegant, light-blue edible flowers, 2 to 3 cm in diameter, with 5 funnel-shaped petals. After fertilization, each of these delicate, short-lived flowers gives way to a capsule containing 2 seeds.

Flax is undemanding and fast-growing, and is often grown as a spring green manure. Thanks to its dense root system, it improves soil structure and decompacts heavy soils. Its carbon-rich stalks make excellent mulch.

Combined with cosmos and nigella flowers, this blue flax makes an attractive addition to vegetable and flower gardens. It can also be enjoyed in pots and window boxes on balconies and terraces.

When to sow blue flax?

Used as a green manure, flax is generally sown from March to July after the last spring frosts. Flowers appear 2 to 2.5 months after sowing. Mow the flax before it goes to seed, leave it on the ground as a mulch, then bury it 3 weeks later for subsequent crops.

This annual plant thrives in sunny to semi-shaded conditions, with moist, draining soil. It can also be grown in pots.

Sow flax seeds directly on the ground, on a previously weeded and surface-scratched surface, at a rate of 5 to 10 grams per square metre. Place the seeds in contact with the soil using a board. The taproots of blue flax can penetrate to a depth of 1 m and loosen the soil in the garden. In addition, this excellent companion plant keeps insect pests (such as Colorado beetles) away from other tomato , eggplant and potato crops.

Blue flax resprouts readily and can be very prolific. Mow the flowers before they go to seed to prevent their spread.

When to harvest flax seed

From July onwards, as soon as the plants turn brown and the capsules emit a dry, jerky sound when shaken, blue flax seeds can be harvested. Cut off whole plants and leave to dry out completely in a sheltered spot. Remove the capsules from the stems and rub them between your hands to extract the seeds. Sort seeds from plant debris using a sieve or by winnowing.

What are the benefits of flaxseed?

Within the Linaceae family, cultivated linseed - Linum usitatissimum - is useful in the vegetable and flower garden, but not only. While these plants make excellent green fertilizer for other crops, flaxseed has numerous medicinal virtues, known for thousands of years. The food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries all love these oil-rich seeds. A source of omega-3 and omega-6, they relieve constipation, excess cholesterol and menopausal disorders. Flax fibers are also used in fabrics, ropes and insulating building materials.",
,"This fast-growing variety has flowers that are very good for mellifluous plants and seeds that are used as a condiment. Although used as a forage plant, mustard is mainly grown as a green manure because of its ability to break up clay clods and improve soil quality.",

,"Red clover, also known as Roussillon clover, is an annual plant of the legume family used as forage or green manure. Its root system develops actively in the first 15 cm of soil, and can extend down to 60 cm. It improves soil structure, stimulates earthworm activity and, after crushing, returns nitrogen to the soil that can be assimilated by other plants.

Characteristics of red red clover

Red red clover, Trifolium incarnatum, is a slow-growing annual plant in the Fabaceae family. Historically, this legume has been appreciated in western France as a forage plant for cattle and horses. It is referenced in Carl Von Linné's Species plantarum of 1753.

Used as a green manure, red clover enriches the soil with nitrogen and improves its structure. In fact, its roots can penetrate up to 60 cm deep into the soil. This melliferous species is distinguished from other clovers by its erect, hairy stems, each bearing purple inflorescences. Not very sensitive to cold, this clover covers the soil effectively during winter.

When to sow red clover?

Although red clover is generally sown after summer crops, from August to October, to cover the soil throughout the winter, it can be mowed and then buried.It can also be sown from March to May and destroyed in late summer.

This annual plant enjoys a sunny exposure and tolerates almost all types of soil, but prefers well-drained loamy soils.

Sow directly in the ground, on previously weeded and surface-scraped soil, at a rate of 2 to 5 g per square metre. Place the seeds in contact with the soil using a board. Beware: red clover is drought-averse, so water regularly during hot spells.

This annual dies naturally after flowering, but can be resown spontaneously from one year to the next.

When does red clover flower?

Red red clover flowers are melliferous, edible and ornamental, blooming from April to August, depending on the sowing date. Rather slow-growing, clover requires plots of land to be available for 3 to 6 months, depending on the sowing period. Mow it before it goes to seed and leave it on the ground as mulch, or bury it after shredding for subsequent crops. Note that once cut short, this clover does not grow back.

,"This small, perennial species is a common forage plant. White clover can be used as a green manure for its ability to enrich the soil with nitrogen, as well as to control weeds. Resistant to trampling, it is ideal for grassing paths.

Fast-growing, this clover can be mowed regularly, and the plant biomass, rich in nitrogenous matter, can be used to mulch or fertilize soil, as well as for animal feed.

Characteristics of white clover

White clover, Trifolium repens, is a perennial plant in the Fabaceae family. This ancient variety, referenced in Carl Von Linné's Species plantarum of 1753, is native to Europe. Due to the priorities assigned to agriculture in France during the Trente Glorieuses, there was little breeding work on white clover, and seed was mainly sourced from New Zealand. In the 1980s, the success of André Pochon's model in Brittany revived interest in growing English ryegrass in association with white clover.

With its small size, rapid regrowth and creeping habit, white clover is ideal for weed control and grazing. It can also be grown as a green manure and, like all legumes, enriches the soil with nitrogen while improving its structure. Highly resistant to trampling, it serves as ground cover during winter. Its green, petiolate leaves are made up of three or four leaflets. Its white, slightly pink, edible and melliferous flowers are grouped in spherical heads.

When to sow white clover?

White clover can be sown both after summer crops, from August to October, and in early spring, from March to May. This perennial plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soil.

Sow directly in the garden, in the open ground, at a rate of 2 and 5 g per square metre. Place the seeds in contact with the soil using a board.

White clover stands up well to summer heat, and its leaves retain their green color even in periods of drought. This perennial species can be mowed 1 or 2 times a year, at the start of flowering, and remains in place for two years. If it goes to seed, it reseeds spontaneously.

When does white clover flower?

White clover flowers, which are edible and highly melliferous, bloom from April to August, depending on the sowing date. For the rest of the year, the plant provides ground cover. Cut once or twice a year, it provides a plant biomass rich in nitrogenous matter, ideal for mulching or fertilizing soils, but also for animal feed. White clover can remain in place for up to two years.

What are the characteristics of Mizuna cabbage?

Mizuna or Japanese mustard, Brassica rapa japonica, from the Brassicaceae family, is an ancient variety native to Japan. It has rosettes of light-green leaves, with a slightly peppery taste reminiscent of arugula. The young shoots can be eaten raw in salads or cooked like  spinach. Hardy and cold-resistant, Japanese cabbage can be grown in winter.

There's also Mizuna Purple Japanese mustard, whose purple-edged leaves offer a more intense taste.

How to sow Mizuna seeds?

This Japanese cabbage can be sown from August to October, in pots, boxes or directly in the ground. This plant can also be grown in pots.

In pots or trays: sow Mizuna seeds 3 weeks before planting in the vegetable garden. When the plants have 4 to 5 leaves, transplant them into the garden, 25 cm apart in all directions. Choose well-drained soil with little shade.

In the garden: sow lightly, in rows 30 cm apart. When plants have 4 to 5 leaves, thin to 30 cm. Mulch to keep the soil cool and moist. Remember to stagger sowing to enjoy this variety for longer.

Spring sowing is possible, provided it is done early enough in the season. The idea is to harvest the leaves before the hot weather, which favors seed set.

How to use Mizuna Japanese mustard?

Mizuna Japanese cabbage is harvested from October to March. The leaves are picked as and when needed, cutting them off at the base of the stem to encourage regrowth.

It's best to eat this plant quickly, as, like all salads, it can be stored in the refrigerator for just a few days. Raw, Mizuna cabbage can be enjoyed as a mesclun, with arugula or lamb's lettuce. Cooked, it can be prepared like spinach, in soup or sautéed in a wok.

Characteristics of Craquante d'Avignon lettuce

Craquante d'Avignon or Craquerelle du Midi, Lactuca sativa, is a mid-season variety first recorded in France in 1800. It is known as ""Winter Density"" in the United States. Resistant to the cold and to going to seed, this Romaine lettuce produces a fairly elongated head with thick, slightly lobed green leaves. Enjoy it raw in salads or cooked.

Sowing Craquante d'Avignon lettuce

The ideal sowing period is from February to May in pots under cover, and from March to July in the garden. Craquante d'Avignon lettuce is harvested from April to November.

Seedlings should be sown one month before planting in the vegetable garden, at a temperature of between 15 and 21°C. Cover the lettuce seeds with a light layer of soil and keep the substrate moist until emergence. Transplant into the garden, 30 cm apart in all directions, once the plants have reached the stage of 4 true leaves. Be careful, however, as transplanting can interfere with the development of the lettuce taproot.

Sow lightly directly in the ground, then thin out to 30 cm in all directions when the plants have 4 true leaves, to encourage harmonious development of the lettuces. Choose humus-rich soil and half-shade exposure. The very small seeds can be mixed with radish seeds to avoid over-dense sowing. Stagger sowing, every 15 days, to enjoy this lettuce for several months.

Companion plants to Craquante d'Avignon lettuce

In the vegetable garden, this variety of lettuce thrives alongside many plants, such as cucumbers, carrots, onions, radishes, cabbage , beet and strawberries.

What are the characteristics of Moroccan cressonnette?
Moroccan cress, Lactuca sativa, also known as ""radichetta"", is an ancient variety native to Italy. It has deeply cut, bright-green leaves with a mild, lamb's lettuce-like flavor. Very hardy, this leaf lettuce is easy to grow in the vegetable garden or in pots.
How to plant Moroccan cress?
This species is sown like spring lettuce, from February to May in pots under cover, and from March to September in the open ground.
Seedlings should be sown one month before planting, at a temperature of between 10 and 18°C. Sow lettuce seeds on the surface, keeping the substrate moist. Transplant into the garden, 30 cm apart in all directions, once the plants have reached the stage of 4 true leaves.
Sowing directly in the garden makes the plants more resistant and less sensitive to going to seed. Choose a semi-shaded position. Sow lightly every 15 days to stagger harvesting. Thin to 10 cm, then 30 cm in all directions.
How to eat watercress
This plant is harvested from April to November. The leaves regrow after each harvest. This lettuce can also be reseeded spontaneously in late autumn and grow well into winter. Best eaten just after harvesting to enjoy its freshness, in salads, soups or vegetable juices.

Characteristics of De Russie winter lettuce

De Russie winter lettuce or Goutte de Sang, Lactuca sativa, is a very old, cold-hardy variety of winter lettuce. Originally from Russia, it is listed in Dominique Guillet's Semences de Kokopelli catalog. De Russie winter lettuce stands out for its long green leaves spotted with red, whose juicy texture can be enjoyed raw in salads, but also cooked, stewed or braised to accompany a wide range of vegetables and meats.

Like Brune d'Hiver and Merveille d'Hiver lettuces, De Russie winter lettuce is sown in late summer and harvested in early spring.

When to sow De Russie winter lettuce?

The ideal sowing period is from August to September in pots under cover, and from September to October in the open ground. You can also grow this variety of winter lettuce in pots, to enjoy on terraces or balconies. It is then harvested from October to April.

Seedlings should be sown one month before planting in the vegetable garden, at a temperature of between 15 and 21°C. Cover the lettuce seeds with a light layer of soil and keep the substrate moist until emergence. Transplant into the garden, 30 cm apart in all directions, once the plants have reached the stage of 4 true leaves. Be careful, however, as transplanting can interfere with the development of the lettuce taproot.

Sow lightly directly in the ground, then thin out to 30 cm in all directions when the plants have 4 true leaves, to encourage harmonious development of the lettuces. Choose humus-rich soil and half-shade exposure. The very small seeds can be mixed with radish seeds to avoid over-dense sowing. Stagger sowing, every 15 days, to enjoy lettuce for several months.

What companion plants for De Russie winter lettuce?

In the vegetable garden, this variety of lettuce thrives alongside many plants, such as cucumbers, carrots, onions, radishes, cabbage , beet and strawberries.

How to eat Russian winter lettuce?

Russian winter lettuce is harvested in early spring, from January to April, before it goes to seed. It's best to eat the leaves just after picking, to take advantage of their freshness, as they don't keep long in the refrigerator crisper. Sweet and juicy, they can be eaten raw in salads, cooked in soups or in vegetable juices.

Rich in vitamins and minerals, lettuce plays a key role in the body's cell renewal. Thanks to its fiber and water content, it also facilitates digestion and transit. In addition, the lactucarium contained in Lactuca Sativa gives it calming properties, useful against insomnia and anxiety.

,"Little Gem romaine lettuce is an old-fashioned variety, halfway between ""romaine"" and ""pommée"". It produces a small head of wavy green leaves, with a firm creamy-yellow center, and offers a crunchy texture and excellent flavor.

Characteristics of Little Gem romaine lettuce

Little Gem romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is an early variety of leafy vegetable first described in England in 1880. Closely related to the ""Sucrine"" lettuce, this compact variety offers a small head of green leaves, with a creamy yellow heart, wavy and crisp. This romaine lettuce can be eaten raw, in salads, or cooked, braised or pan-fried.

Sowing Little Gem romaine lettuce

The ideal sowing period is from February to May in pots under cover, and from March to September in the garden. You can also grow this variety of lettuce in pots, to enjoy on terraces or balconies. Romaine lettuce is harvested from April to November.

Seedlings should be sown one month before planting in the vegetable garden, at a temperature of between 15 and 21°C. Cover the lettuce seeds with a light layer of soil and keep the substrate moist until emergence. Transplant into the garden, 20 cm apart in all directions, once the plants have reached the stage of 4 true leaves.

Light sow directly in the ground, then thin out to 20 cm in all directions when the plants have 4 true leaves, to encourage harmonious lettuce development. Choose humus-rich soil and half-shade exposure. The very small seeds can be mixed with radish seeds to avoid over-dense sowing. Stagger sowing, every 15 days, to enjoy this lettuce for several months.

Romaine lettuce companion plants

In the vegetable garden, this variety of lettuce grows harmoniously with radishes, cucumbers, carrots, onions, cabbage , beet and strawberries.

How should Little Gem romaine lettuce be eaten?

This variety of romaine lettuce can be harvested as needed, from April to November. Although the leaves can be kept for a few days in the fridge, it's best to eat them immediately after picking to enjoy their freshness. Crunchy and delicious, this lettuce can be eaten raw in salads or cooked, braised or pan-fried.

Rich in vitamins and minerals, lettuce plays a key role in the body's cell renewal. Thanks to its fiber and water content, it also facilitates digestion and transit. In addition, the lactucarium contained in Lactuca sativa gives it calming properties, useful against insomnia and anxiety.

Characteristics of Bourguignonne winter lettuce

Bourguignonne winter lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is an early variety of leafy vegetable native to France. Also known as ""Grosse Blonde d'Hiver"", it was mentioned in Vilmorin-Andrieux's 1885 book Les Plantes Potagères. This hardy variety offers a large, fairly tall head with waffle-shaped, pale-green leaves, whose juicy texture can be enjoyed raw in salads, but also cooked, stewed or braised to accompany a wide range of vegetables and meats.

Like Brune d'Hiver and Merveille d'Hiver lettuces, Pommée d'Hiver Bourguignonne is sown in late summer and harvested in early spring.

When to sow head lettuce?

The ideal sowing period is from August to September in pots under cover, and from September to October in the garden. It can then be harvested from January to April.

Seedlings should be sown one month before planting in the vegetable garden, at a temperature of between 15 and 21°C. Cover the lettuce seeds with a light layer of soil and keep the substrate moist until emergence. Transplant into the garden, 30 cm apart in all directions, once the plants have reached the stage of 4 true leaves.

Light sow directly in the ground, then thin out to 30 cm in all directions when the plants have 4 true leaves, to encourage harmonious lettuce development. Choose humus-rich soil and half-shade exposure. The very small seeds can be mixed with radish seeds to avoid over-dense sowing. Stagger sowing, every 15 days, to enjoy this lettuce for several months.

Lettuce companion plants in the vegetable garden

In the vegetable garden, this variety of lettuce thrives alongside many other plants, such as cucumbers, carrots, onions, radishes, cabbage , beet and strawberries.

How to eat Burgundian winter lettuce?

This winter lettuce is harvested as needed, from January to April. Although the leaves can be kept for a few days in the fridge, it's best to eat them immediately after picking to enjoy their freshness. Sweet and juicy, they can be eaten raw in salads, cooked braised or pan-fried, or in vegetable juices.

Rich in vitamins and minerals, lettuce plays a key role in cell renewal. Thanks to its fiber and water content, it also facilitates digestion and transit. In addition, the lactucarium contained in Lactuca sativa gives it calming properties, useful against insomnia and anxiety.

,"This old variety produces an apple with green leaves, tinged with pink-brown, offering a tender, crunchy texture.
It is adapted to a wide range of growing conditions.
For example, on January 17, St. Antoine's Day, it was customary in many places to sow the first lettuce, whatever the weather - snow or frost having no effect on the day. This Anthony has nothing to do with his Paduan namesake. He lived as a hermit over 1300 years before him. Although this saint has now been replaced on the calendar by Roseline, this hasn't stopped many gardeners perpetuating their habits, and at the start of each year they ask seed merchants for Saint-Antoine lettuce. Of course, this name is not official and does not appear in the catalog of authorized varieties.

,"Saint Vincent leaf lettuce is a very old variety, with broad, blond-green leaves tinged with red. They have a tender texture and mild flavor.

Characteristics of Saint Vincent leaf lettuce

Saint Vincent Cutting Lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is a mid-season variety native to the United States. This ancient variety has been reintroduced by The Abundant Life Seed Foundation. It has broad, embossed leaves of golden green tinged with red. Like all cutting lettuces, new leaves develop after successive harvests. Its mild flavor can be enjoyed raw in salads or baked. Very hardy, this lettuce is easy to grow in the vegetable garden or in pots.

How to sow Saint Vincent leaf lettuce?

This variety is sown like romaine lettuce, from February to May in pots under cover, and from March to September in the garden. It is then harvested from April to November.

Seedlings should be sown one month before planting, at a temperature of between 10 and 18°C. Sow lettuce seeds on the surface, keeping the substrate moist. Transplant into the vegetable garden, 30 cm apart in all directions, once the plants have reached the stage of 4 true leaves.

Sowing directly in the garden makes the plants more resistant and less susceptible to going to seed. Sow light, directly in the ground, then thin out to 30 cm in all directions when the plants have 4 true leaves, to promote harmonious lettuce development. Choose humus-rich soil and half-shade exposure. The very small seeds can be mixed with radish seeds to avoid over-dense sowing. Stagger sowing, every 15 days, for several months' enjoyment.

When to harvest cutting lettuce

This lettuce is harvested from April to November. Cut off peripheral leaves, one by one, as needed. New leaves develop after successive cuts. Cutting lettuce can also be reseeded spontaneously in late autumn, and grows well into winter. Preferably eat the leaves just after picking to enjoy their freshness, in salads, soups or vegetable juices.

Characteristics of Brown Winter Lettuce

Brune d'Hiver lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is a hardy, cold-hardy variety native to France. Also known as ""Passion Brune"" winter lettuce, it was first mentioned in 1883 in Vilmorin-Andrieux's Les Plantes Potagères . This early-maturing, medium-sized variety has light-green leaves with a reddish-brown tinge from the first frosts. Like Rousse d'Hiver and Merveille d'Hiver lettuces, Brune d'Hiver is sown from late summer to autumn and harvested in early spring. It can be eaten raw in salads or cooked like spinach.

When to sow Brown Winter lettuce?

The ideal sowing period is from August to September in pots under cover, and from September to October in the garden. Passion Brune winter lettuce is harvested from January to April.

Seedlings should be sown one month before planting in the vegetable garden, at a temperature of between 15 and 21°C. Cover the lettuce seeds with a light layer of soil and keep the substrate moist until emergence. Transplant into the garden, 30 cm apart in all directions, once the plants have reached the stage of 4 true leaves. Be careful, however, as transplanting can interfere with the development of the lettuce taproot.

Sow lightly directly in the ground, then thin out to 30 cm in all directions when the plants have 4 true leaves, to encourage harmonious development of the lettuces. Choose humus-rich soil and half-shade exposure. The very small seeds can be mixed with radish seeds to avoid over-dense sowing. Stagger sowing, every 15 days, to enjoy lettuce for several months.

What companion plants should I use with Brown Winter lettuce?

In the vegetable garden, this variety of lettuce grows harmoniously with radishes, cucumbers, carrots, onions, cabbage , beet and strawberries.

,"This variety of leafy vegetable produces 7 to 8 heads 10 to 15 cm in diameter. Green with purple tints, they offer fine flesh and excellent flavor.

Imperial Star artichokes are vigorous growers.

What are the characteristics of the Imperial Star artichoke?

The Imperial Star artichoke, Cynara scolymus, is a mid-season variety from Italy. This plant has 7 to 8 round, greenish-purple heads weighing up to 400 g and 15 cm in diameter. Their soft, tender flesh can be eaten raw or cooked. The flowers attract pollinating insects.

When to sow Imperial Star artichoke seeds?

Sow this variety of leafy vegetable in pots or trays, under light cover or trays, from February to April or September to October. It thrives in rich, well-drained, humus-rich soil and sunny exposure. Artichokes are harvested between April and October.


	Sow artichokes in potting soil, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds;
	When the artichokes have 2 leaves, transplant the best plants into full sunlight, spaced 1 m apart in all directions. Do not bury the artichoke crowns to prevent rotting.


You can also sow the seeds directly in the garden, 1 m apart in all directions. Caution: protect artichoke plants in winter, as they are sensitive to temperatures below -5°C. Before the first frosts, cut back the foliage and protect the plants with a good mulch.

What are the effects of artichokes?

Artichokes are known for their diuretic and antioxidant properties. The leaves, which contain cynarin, protect the liver and gall bladder. This low-calorie food is a source of fiber and vitamins, particularly B9.

These fragile plants should be eaten soon after harvesting. Their leaves can be enjoyed hot or cold, often presented with a vinaigrette or aioli sauce. Artichoke bottoms are served stuffed or steamed, but the plant can also be eaten raw, when the heads are young and tender.",

What are the characteristics of the Cuban claytone?

The Cuban claytone, Claytonia perfoliata, is a mid-season variety native to Cuba. Highly resistant to frost (down to -20°C), this forgotten vegetable can be harvested all winter long if sown at the right time. Winter purslane produces round, fleshy green leaves, inside which nestle small clusters of white flowers. From 20 to 40 cm high, this annual plant decorates the vegetable garden and, raw or cooked, graces the kitchen table.

When to sow Cuban claytone?

The ideal sowing period is from April to October in the open ground. Cuban claytone likes acidic, humus-rich soil, and half-shade. The ideal germination temperature is 12°C, but 4°C may be sufficient. As its name suggests, winter purslane is extremely cold-resistant.

Sow seeds directly in the vegetable garden, very lightly and shallowly, in rows 25 cm apart. Keep the soil cool and moist, watering lightly. Thin to 10 cm when plants have 4 to 5 leaves.

In the garden, Cuban claytone gets on well with all plant species and varieties. It's a great addition to small, unoccupied spaces in the vegetable garden. Winter purslane can also be grown in pots.

When to harvest Cuba claytone?

Cuba claytone can be harvested all year round, except in March, April and May. The first leaves can be enjoyed 2 months after sowing. It's best to pick leaf by leaf to encourage regrowth. Cuban claytone produces several harvests a year. Be careful not to uproot the plants, which have a very shallow root system, when harvesting. Winter purslane, like all purslane, can be easily reseeded from one year to the next.

Cuban claytone: a forgotten vegetable

Although the Cuban claytone was introduced to Europe in the 19th century along with the Marmande tomato, it has not enjoyed the same success. Yet it's an excellent edible plant that's easy to grow. In the kitchen, it goes well with lettuce, peppers or tomatoes, and adds a touch of elegance to any plate. Raw, the small, fleshy leaves add freshness to salads. Cooked, they can be enjoyed in the same way as spinach. However, the leaves wilt once harvested.",

What are the characteristics of strawberry spinach?

Strawberry spinach, Chenopodium capitatum or Blitum capitatum, is a species of leafy vegetable native to North America. It was first mentioned in Vilmorin-Andrieux's Les Plantes Potagères in 1883. Now cultivated for both its appearance and nutritional qualities, this original, hardy plant forms a rosette of triangular, toothed, dark-green leaves, which can be prepared cooked or raw. Its juicy red berries, similar to small strawberries, are appreciated for their sweet, beet-like flavor.

How to sow strawberry spinach?

This species is sown from April to June in the open ground, directly in the vegetable garden. This plant prefers rich, cool, clay soil, and a half-shaded position. Too much heat can be detrimental to the development of strawberry spinach. For cultivation in greenhouses or unheated conservatories, it is possible to sow in autumn for harvesting in winter.


	Sow seeds directly in place, 2 cm deep, in rows 30 cm apart;
	Mulch the soil to keep the spinach cool;
	Thin to 25 or 30 cm when the plant has 4 to 5 leaves;
	Water regularly.


In the vegetable garden, this plant enjoys the company of beans, cabbage, celery and lettuce.

How to eat strawberry spinach

Harvesting takes place between June and October. Pick the leaves one by one as needed, to stimulate the appearance of new ones. Be careful to eat them in moderation, as they contain oxalic acid, also known as ""sorrel salt"". In small doses, this substance binds calcium. In large quantities, it can cause kidney problems and dietary deficiencies. As for the fruit, it should be harvested when ripe and burgundy in color.

In cooking, the leaves can be eaten raw in salads, or cooked. The juicy fruit is used to make jam and coulis.

,"This old variety is slow to bolt, stores well and is very productive. Its bulbs are large, round and slightly flattened, with a thick, coppery-yellow skin.

What are the characteristics of the Stuttgarter onion?

The Stuttgarter or De Stuttgart onion, also known as ""Stuttgarter riesen"", Allium cepa, is a very old variety from Germany. It produces large, round, slightly flattened bulbs with coppery-yellow skins and white flesh. These bulbs are topped by hollow stems that are eaten like spring onions. This mid-season variety is known for its exceptional yield and winter storage.

How to plant Stuttgarter onions?

Stuttgarter onions are sown from February to April in trays, under a light shelter, and from March to May directly in the vegetable garden. It prefers sunny exposure and well-drained soil. Onion bulbs need 12 to 14 hours of sunshine a day to ripen.

In mild climates, they can be sown in autumn. Harvest the following spring.

In trays: lightly cover the onion seeds, lead and water. Transplant after the last frost, when plants are 10 cm high. Place one plant every 15 cm, in rows 20 cm apart.

Directly in the ground: sow lightly in rows 20 cm apart. When plants reach 10 cm in height, keep one plant every 15 cm.

What companion plants should onions be grown with?

In the vegetable garden, onions and carrots make a good duo. The former repels onion flies, and vice versa. Brassicas , beets, strawberries, tomatoes and lettuces can also be planted close to onions.

However, avoid planting beans and peas in the middle of onion plants.

When to harvest Stuttgarter onions?

Yellow onions are harvested from May to October, when the stems have dried out. To store, cut or braid the leaves and store the bulbs in a warm, airy place for 10 to 15 days, until the first skins have dried out. Avoid rough handling. Check beforehand that they have not been bruised, and check them regularly to avoid contaminating the whole crop.

What are the characteristics of the Bleu de Solaize leek?

The Bleu de Solaize leek, Allium porrum, is a variety of leafy vegetable selected in 1942 in the commune of Solaize, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. It is a cross between the Midi leek and the Savoie leek. Bleu de Solaize produces long, voluminous, bluish-leaved barrels weighing from 100 to 400 g.

This hardy biennial vegetable is highly resistant to cold and to going to seed, and can be harvested throughout the winter.

When to sow Bleu de Solaize leeks?

This leek variety can be sown from February to April under cover, and from March to June in the open ground. Choose a semi-shaded position.

In pots or nurseries: cover the seeds with 0.5 cm of potting soil, lightly pack the substrate and keep it cool. If necessary, thin out about 1 month after sowing. When plants are pencil-sized and 15 cm high, cut off a third of the leaves and transplant every 10 to 12 cm, 10 cm deep into a furrow, in rows 30 cm apart. Make sure to leave the furrow open and close it again as you ridge the soil.

Directly in place: sow in the garden, in rows 30 cm apart.

For autumn sowing, sow in situ or in a nursery at the end of August, transplanting in November for a spring harvest. In autumn, plant the plants in the ground to whiten the boles.

What companion plants should I grow with leeks?

In the garden, leeks grow harmoniously with many plants, such as onions and celery. It repels the carrot fly, which in turn repels the leek fly. Spinach and tomatoes are also good companion plants, as they repel the Alliaceae moth.

However, we advise against growing beet close to leeks.

How to store leeks

Between June and February, harvest leeks as needed, when they reach 20-30 cm in length. They can be stored raw in the refrigerator crisper for about 10 days. To keep for up to 6 months, remove the green part of the leaves and roots, clean the drums, blanch and freeze. The green part of the leaves, rich in antioxidants, can also be eaten blanched or in tempura.

Leeks can be eaten raw or cooked, on their own or with meat or fish.

What are the characteristics of De Chioggia pink and white beet?

De Chioggia pink and white beet, Ceta vulgaris, is an ancient mid-season variety from Italy. Also known as "" Barbabietola rossa di Chioggia"", this red-skinned root vegetable first appeared in 1840, in the market gardens around Venice. Prepared in carpaccio or grated into salads, its sweet pink flesh with white veins is a delight to eat.

How to grow De Chioggia pink and white beet?

This root vegetable variety can be sown from March to May in pots, and from April to July in the garden. Be careful, however, not to sow too early: this beet can go to seed very quickly.

To sow in a bucket, bury the seeds 5-7 mm deep in sowing compost, then water abundantly. Transplant when the plants reach the 5-6 leaf stage, after the first frosts.

De Chioggia pink and white beet can also be sown in the vegetable garden. Although this variety thrives in sunny locations, it's best to plant it in cool soil because, like all root vegetables, it's drought-averse. We therefore recommend frequent watering and mulching to conserve moisture, in soil enriched with mature compost. Maintain a distance of 20 cm between seeds, thinning out if necessary to encourage the growth of the most vigorous plants.

What companion plants should I grow with De Chioggia beet?

Although De Chioggia pink and white beet is a disease-resistant variety, it can nevertheless be affected by mildew and rust if over-watered.

Beets are best grown with companion plants: Cipollini Jaune onion, Saint Blaise romaine lettuce, batavia lettuce and other leafy greens...

How to store De Chioggia beet?

De Chioggia beets are harvested from July to December. Roots to be preserved should be stripped of their tops, wiped dry and stored in a cool, dark place, such as a cellar. Burying them in dry sand preserves them throughout the winter.

In the kitchen, they are excellent vegetables, rich in vitamins A, B1, B2, B6 and C. They can be used in a wide range of recipes: in salads, raw or cooked, grated or in carpaccio.

Their leaves, which are also a good source of minerals and trace elements, contain as much iron as spinach. The root provides other substances: choline, folate, iodine, manganese, sodium, potassium, fiber and carbohydrates. This beet facilitates blood regeneration, making it a dish of choice in cases of hemorrhage, convalescence or preparation for childbirth.

Characteristics of Albino white beet

White Albino beet, Beta vulgaris, is an early root vegetable variety native to Holland. It takes the form of a round root 15 to 20 cm in diameter. Highly appreciated for its mild, sweet flavor, its thick, white flesh can be cooked or raw, in salads or soups. You can also eat its wavy leaves, an excellent source of minerals and trace elements.

How to sow Albino white beet seeds?

White beet is sown from March to May in pots, and from April to July in the ground. This vegetable plant is biennial: it only produces the following year, and requires a long period of cold weather to go to seed.

To sow in a bucket, bury the seeds 0.5-1 cm deep in potting soil, then water abundantly. Germination takes 5 to 10 days, depending on temperature (12°C to 26°C). Transplant when plants have developed 5-6 leaves, after the first frosts, 20 cm apart in all directions.

If sowing is possible in a bucket, it's best to sow Albino White Beet directly in the garden. Although it thrives in sunny spots, it's best to plant it in rich, cool soil, as, like all root vegetables, it's sensitive to drought. We therefore recommend regular watering and mulching to conserve moisture, in soil enriched with mature compost. Maintain a distance of 20 cm between seeds, thinning out to encourage the growth of the most vigorous plants.

What companion plants should I grow with white beet?

Albino white beet is a disease-resistant variety. However, mildew and rust can affect it at the end of the season.

Beets are best grown with companion plants: cauliflower, onion, lettuce and other leafy vegetables...

How to store white beet?

White beets are harvested from July until the first frosts. Roots intended for preservation should be dried for a few days, stripped of their tops, wiped dry and stored in a cool, dark place, such as a cellar. Burying them in a silo filled with sand or straw preserves them throughout the winter. Alternatively, beets can be cut up and stored raw in dry sterilized jars, or cooked and frozen.

How to cook white beet

Like the pink and white Chioggia beet, this variety can be eaten raw or cooked. It can be used in a wide range of recipes: in soups, creams, gratins, vegetable chips or salads; grated or in carpaccio.

Before preparation, beet must be freed from soil and gently washed. Beetroot can be boiled, steamed, stewed or baked whole, with the skin on. For easy peeling, plunge the root into cold water after cooking. The tops can be eaten raw, in salads, or cooked like spinach.

Red, purple, orange and yellow beets are also available.

What are the benefits of beet?

Beets are excellent vegetables, rich in minerals and vitamins A, B1, B2, B6 and C. The root provides many interesting substances: choline, folate, iodine, manganese, sodium, potassium, fiber and carbohydrates. In addition to its antioxidant power, beet facilitates blood regeneration, making it an excellent choice for haemorrhage, convalescence or preparation for childbirth. The leaves contain as much, if not more, iron than spinach.

Origin of Atomic Red carrots

Atomic Red Carrot, Daucus carota, is an early variety native to the United States. Its crunchy, elongated roots, 15 to 20 cm long, stand out for their pronounced flavor. They owe their blood-red color to their high lycopene content, a natural antioxidant pigment also found in tomatoes. This variety can be eaten raw, cut into strips or grated into salads, but it's when cooked that its sweetness is revealed. The color intensifies with cooking, closer to the red of beet.

How to sow Atomic Red carrot seeds?

Atomic Red carrot seeds are sown directly in the ground, from February to July. Choose a sunny spot to set up your crop, and favor rich, well-drained soil that stays cool.


	Sow carrot seeds in the vegetable garden, in rows 25 cm apart. Cover with a thin layer of soil and lightly plumb. Emergence takes place 6 to 21 days after sowing, at temperatures between 10 and 24°C. Keep the soil moist until the carrot seeds have germinated;
	When plants have 3 leaves, thin to 5 cm, then a few weeks later, to 8 cm. Protect young shoots from slugs if possible;
	Water regularly in the month following sowing to encourage good root development;
	Mulch the soil to keep the carrots cool.


Be careful during the first three weeks of root development: compressed soil and the presence of stones may deform the carrot as it matures.

What companion plants should I grow with carrots?

In the vegetable garden, carrots grow harmoniously with many other plants. Lettuce, tomatoes, beans and leeks make good companion plants. Onions, sage, mugwort and rosemary keep flies away, and carrots, like other plants in the Apiaceae family, attract many beneficial insects to the garden.

When to harvest Atomic Red carrots?

This variety of carrot can be harvested from June until the first frost, 75 days after sowing. If plants are mulched or frost-free, they can be harvested all year round, right up to flowering in spring.

To store, let the carrots dry for a few days before cutting off the tops a few centimetres above the collar, then wipe dry and store in a sheltered place such as a gauge, silo or cellar. They can also be stored in the ground in the vegetable garden. Cover them with a good layer of straw or leaves, at least 20 to 25 cm high, to protect them from frost. Carrots also keep well grated and lacto-fermented.

How to cook red carrots

Red carrots may surprise you with their rich flavor and bright color, but they're also a concentrate of vitamins and minerals. The Atomic Red variety stands out for its high lycopene content, a carotenoid responsible for its red hue. This phytonutrient is mainly known for its antioxidant properties, its benefits for the skin and its contribution to the prevention of certain cancers.

In the kitchen, carrots can be eaten raw, grated into salads, or steamed, pan-fried, roasted or simmered. As carrots are 90% water, they can also be made into juices and syrups.

Characteristics of the Paris Round Carrot

The Paris Market Round Carrot, Daucus carota, is an early variety of root vegetable native to France. Already listed in the 19th century, it was introduced in Vilmorin-Andrieux's Les Plantes Potagères in 1890 as a ""very short red carrot with frame"". Its orange, round roots, 8 to 10 cm in diameter, are renowned for their tender, deliciously sweet flesh.

Growing the Paris Market Round Carrot

This Paris Market carrot can be sown directly in the ground, from February to July. Choose a sunny spot for planting, and favor rich, well-drained soil that stays cool. Because of its small size, this round carrot can also be grown in pots.


	Sow carrot seeds in the vegetable garden, in rows 25 cm apart. Cover with a thin layer of soil and plumb lightly. Emergence takes place 6 to 21 days after sowing, at temperatures between 10 and 24°C. Keep the soil moist until the carrot seeds have germinated;
	When plants have 3 leaves, thin to 5 cm, then a few weeks later, to 8 cm. Protect young shoots from slugs if possible;
	Water regularly in the month following sowing to encourage good root development;
	Mulch the soil to keep the carrots cool.


Be careful during the first three weeks of root development: compressed soil and the presence of stones may deform the carrot as it matures.

To help carrots develop properly, consider planting companion plants close to the crop: onion, tomato, lettuce, radish, cabbage, etc.

Harvesting the Paris Market Round Carrot

This variety of carrot is harvested from June to the first frosts, 60 to 80 days after sowing. If the plants are protected by mulch or if there is no frost, they can be harvested all year round, right up to flowering in spring.

To store, let the carrots dry for a few days before cutting off the tops a few centimetres above the collar, then wipe dry and store in a sheltered place such as a gauge, silo or cellar. They can also be stored in the ground in the vegetable garden. Cover them with a good layer of straw or leaves, at least 20 to 25 cm high, to protect them from frost. Carrots also keep well grated and lacto-fermented.

The benefits of carrots

In the 13th century, carrots were considered primarily as a spice, especially for their leaves and seeds. The fruit was mainly used as feed for cattle and horses. It wasn't until the early 20th century that carotene and its benefits were discovered.

While the Paris Market carrot's originality lies in its round shape and small size, it is also appreciated for its nutritional qualities. Rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, its concentrated beta-carotene gives it powerful antioxidant properties. Like the Dolciva (improved Nantaise) or Chantenay red-heart carrots, this variety slows aging, regulates intestinal transit and helps prevent certain cancers.

Rich in vitamins A, B, C and E, as well as beta-carotene, this root vegetable promotes healing and regeneration, and helps regulate intestinal transit. In the kitchen, carrots can be eaten raw, grated into salads, or steamed, pan-fried, roasted or simmered. As carrots are 90% water, they can also be made into juices and syrups.

,"Red Meat radish is a variety that produces round, green and white roots 5 to 10 cm in diameter. The purple-pink flesh is crunchy, juicy, mildly pungent and particularly sweet.

Characteristics of the Red Meat winter radish

Red Meat radish, Raphanus sativus, is a mid-season variety native to China. It is also known as the ""Misato Rose"" radish, the ""Watermelon"" radish or the ""Watermelon"" radish, in reference to its rounded shape and color. In fact, its round root, with its green and white skin, encloses pomegranate-pink flesh. Its taste is mild, sweet and not very spicy. A staple of Asian cuisine, Red Meat radish garnishes dishes and complements sauces. Grated into salads, carpaccio, pickled or in brine, this root vegetable can be enjoyed all winter long. The young leaves are also edible, raw or cooked like spinach.

When to sow Red Meat radishes?

Although this variety of root vegetable can be sown from May onwards, it is best suited to summer and autumn sowing for a fall and winter harvest. Generally large in size, winter radishes require particularly loose soil to thrive.

Sow radish seeds in the vegetable garden, in rows 30 cm apart. Thin to 10 or 15 cm along the row. Choose mid-sun exposure. To stagger harvesting, repeat sowing every 15 days. Water regularly.

In the vegetable garden, radishes grow harmoniously alongside many other vegetables: lettuce, carrots, peas and cucumbers.

How to store Red Meat radishes

Winter Red Meat radishes are harvested from October to March, 2 to 3 months after sowing. Its pungent taste is accentuated by dry spells and late harvests. Unlike all-month radishes, winter radishes can be stored for several months. Remove the tops from the roots, wipe dry and store in a sheltered place, such as a gauge, silo or cellar. If you bury them in sand, they'll keep all winter. They can also be left in the fridge for a few days.

Red Meat radishes are particularly suitable for pickling or lacto-fermenting.

Harvesting and storing White Beauty radishes

White Beauty round white radishes are harvested from March to November. This variety is harvested 30 to 40 days after sowing, when the root is not too large and the tops are a beautiful green color. Its pungent taste is accentuated by dry spells and late harvests.

Unlike winter radishes, every-month radishes don't keep long in cellars or silos. The root is usually eaten immediately after harvesting, raw or cooked. It will keep for a week in the refrigerator crisper, and for a few months when prepared pickle-style.

The leaves are not edible.

What are the characteristics of tuberous chervil?

Tuberous chervil ( Chaerophyllum bulbosum) is an ancient variety of root vegetable native to Eastern Europe. Its shape is similar to that of a small carrot, while its slightly sweet taste is more reminiscent of chestnuts and potatoes. Its white, melting flesh can be eaten raw or cooked, pan-fried, mashed, in soup or stewed.

Caution: the leaves of this plant are toxic.

When to plant tuberous chervil?

Seed tuberous chervil in the ground, either in late autumn or early spring. This plant needs a cold spell of at least 6 weeks to break dormancy and germinate.


	November to December: sow lightly, directly in the garden, in rows 20 cm apart. Choose a cool spot with little shade. After seed emergence, thin to 10 cm along the row;
	February to March: before sowing in the garden, store seeds in the refrigerator for 6 weeks or place in a pot outdoors over winter.


Hoe and water regularly in dry weather to keep roots tender.

This root vegetable is a good companion plant for radishes, lettuce and carrots, as well as dill and coriander. It repels aphids, ants and slugs.

How to store tuberous chervil?

Harvest when leaves are fully yellow, from June to August. Roots should be firm and free of dark spots. To store, remove the tops, wipe dry and store in a cool, dark place, such as a cellar. Their flavor improves after 2 to 3 months' storage in sand. It is also possible to freeze them, but this method makes the chervil porous after a few months.

What recipes can be made with tuberous chervil?

Tuberous chervil is a low-calorie vegetable, rich in fiber and vitamins A, B and C.

In the kitchen, this root can be prepared in the same way as carrots or parsnips. It's best to wash it well, then peel it. Raw, it can be grated. Cooked, it can be simmered, roasted, pan-fried or steamed. Be careful not to overcook, or the flesh will become fibrous.

This vegetable can be incorporated into many recipes. It goes well with fish and meat, but also with other root vegetables such as onions, leeks and squash.",
,"This giant, slow-growing variety produces a green-white apple weighing up to 2.5 kg. Whatever its size, the flesh remains tender without ever becoming fibrous.

Long abandoned, the perpetual leek (also known as wild leek, perennial leek or vine leek) is making a comeback in the garden!
Indeed, its hardiness, ease of cultivation (virtually no maintenance) and nutritional and therapeutic qualities make it an ally in the vegetable garden not to be overlooked. Raw, it adds a slightly piquant, spicy flavor to salads, and cooked, it can be used in many dishes in the same way as ""classic"" leeks.
A fine example of nature's generosity, it multiplies 10 to 20 times by bulblet and several hundred times by seed!
Perpetual leeks are harvested from August to June for in-place plantings. For spring transplants, the first harvest takes place between the third and fourth month of cultivation.",

This highly productive variety has vigorous growth and a branched habit.

Corno di Toro Giallo sweet yellow pepper characteristics

The sweet yellow pepper Corno di Toro Giallo, Capsicum annuum, is a mid-season variety introduced to Italy before 1920. It is a yellow variant of the sweet red pepper ""Corno di Toro Rosso"". This 40-50 cm-high plant produces very juicy, yellow-orange, horn-shaped fruits about 20 cm long. Their sweet, fragrant flesh can be enjoyed raw in salads or cooked, marinated, grilled or stuffed.

When to grow the Corno di Toro Giallo sweet yellow pepper?

The ideal sowing period is from the end of February to May, in pots under a well-lit shelter at between 16 and 20°C. The higher the ambient temperature, the faster the seeds germinate.


	Sow seeds in potting soil;
	Water the seeds with a sprayer and keep the substrate moist;
	Place sweet yellow pepper seedlings indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into individual pots when plants reach the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants out of the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting in the vegetable garden, take the sweet peppers outside during the day to acclimatize them to the outdoors;
	After 8 to 10 weeks, transplant the whole clump into the soil of the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Sweet peppers thrive in deep, moist, aerated soil;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between sweet pepper plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water plants regularly after planting, without touching leaves or flowers.


Peppers appreciate the presence of basil, carrots, borage and oregano.  

How to store the Corno di Toro Giallo sweet yellow pepper?

The Corno di Toro variety is harvested from July to October, preferably when the fruit is yellow and ripe.

If stored in a cool, dry place, the sweet yellow pepper will keep for a week. To keep longer, they can be frozen, marinated in vinegar or oil, or made into sterilized jars. In the kitchen, sweet peppers are an ideal accompaniment to all kinds of dishes. This vitamin-rich plant can also be enjoyed stuffed or simply grilled.

What are the characteristics of the Chocolate bell pepper?

Derived from several varieties, such as the ""Merrimack Wonder"", ""Burlington"" and accession number ""PB9-49-134"" peppersthe Chocolate bell pepper, Capsicum annuum, is an early variety developed in 1965 by the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station in the United States. When ripe, Chocolate peppers produce elongated, fleshy, slightly ribbed chocolate-red fruits. Their mild, sweet flesh is appreciated for its taste, and can be enjoyed in salads, stuffed in the oven or in ratatouille.

When to sow Chocolate bell pepper seeds?

The ideal sowing period is from the end of February to May, in a bucket under a well-lit shelter at between 16 and 20°C. The higher the ambient temperature, the faster the seeds germinate.


	Sow seeds in potting soil;
	Water the seeds with a sprayer and keep the substrate moist;
	Install Chocolate bell pepper seedlings indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into individual pots when plants reach the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants out of the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting in the vegetable garden, take the peppers outside during the day to acclimatize them to the outdoors;
	After 8 to 10 weeks, transplant the whole clump into the soil of the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Peppers thrive in deep, moist, aerated soil;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between bell pepper plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water regularly after planting, without touching the leaves or flowers.


Chocolate peppers enjoy basil, carrots, borage and oregano. 

How to store Chocolate peppers?

Under the right climatic conditions, peppers and chillies grow very quickly. This early variety is harvested from May to October, preferably when the fruit is ripe and the skin is chocolate-red. Like tomatoes, they continue to ripen and take on color after harvest, but the flavor is better if the fruit remains on the plants longer.

Chocolate peppers will keep for a week if stored in a cool, dry place. To keep longer, they can also be frozen (after blanching), dried (in the oven or dehydrator) or marinated in oil.

,"Characteristics of the Merveille des Marchés tomato
The Merveille des Marchés tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an old mid-season variety from France. It is mentioned in Vilmorin-Andrieux's 1885 book Les Plantes Potagères. Its round, smooth, red fruits, weighing 130 to 180 g and resistant to shattering, contain pink, fragrant flesh ideal for stuffed vegetable recipes. With its smooth, very thin skin, this variety is also ideal for making sauces and coulis.
Merveille des Marchés tomato seedlings
Merveille des Marchés tomatoes can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature between 16 and 20°C.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Greenhouse plants can be transplanted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
Keep a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.

Tomato plant care
The Merveille des Marchés tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to lengthen and form numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers. Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the tomatoes and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.
To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew or apical necrosis, we recommend regular, but not excessive, watering of tomato plants, without wetting the leaves or flowers. You can also mulch the soil to conserve moisture, and use organic preventive treatments such as nettle purin and comfrey.
Tomato companion plants
In the vegetable garden, tomatoes enjoy the company of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tagetes and basil, which repel pests and improve yields. However, we advise against combining potatoes and eggplants with tomato plants.
Harvesting Merveille des Marchés tomatoes
These tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This is a crop that offers an abundance of fruit per plant in one season. Raw or cooked, this variety lends itself to both salads and stuffed dishes. Its pink, fragrant flesh goes well with sunny vegetables, meats and fish.

	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to the outdoors;
	As soon as the plants are strong, transplant the whole clump into the ground in full sunlight, after the last frosts (ice saints in May). Greenhouse plants can be transplanted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;


Water Saint Pierre tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.

It's a good idea to plant companion plants between tomatoes, such as Oregon tagetes or Cinnamon basil, to repel pests.

How often should I water Saint Pierre tomato plants?

To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew or apical necrosis, it's important to follow our cultivation advice:


	Water Saint Pierre tomato plants regularly, but not excessively;
	Water at the base of the plants, avoiding wetting the foliage and flowers;
	Mulch the soil to retain moisture.


Is it necessary to prune tomato plants?

Saint Pierre mid-season red tomatoes have an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will therefore continue to lengthen and form numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers.

We advise against pruning the plants. This can cause open wounds to the tomatoes and lead to disease. However, it is possible to keep these bulky plants in cages or on ladders.

When to harvest Saint Pierre tomatoes

Saint Pierre red tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This highly productive crop can produce several kilos of fruit per plant in a single season.

,"The Crimean Black tomato is a vigorous variety with an abundance of round, dense, red-brown flesh that darkens in the sun. It has a very mild, acid-free taste.

The variety is not very sensitive to drought.

Characteristics of the Black Crimean tomato

The Crimean black tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an ancient mid-season variety from the Black Sea region of Crimea. This very drought-resistant vegetable has an indeterminate growth habit. Its fruits are round, reddish-brown and low in seeds, weighing from 150 to 500 g. Their dense, low-acid, slightly sweet flesh is delicious in summer salads.

How to grow the Black Crimean tomato?

Black Crimean tomatoes can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C.


	Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
	Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
	Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
	As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Greenhouse plants can be transplanted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
	Keep a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.


How to care for a tomato plant?

Although vigorous, this variety can be affected by diseases such as mildew (a fungus generally caused by excess humidity) and apical necrosis.) and apical necrosis (due to mineral deficiencies caused by irregular watering of the tomato plant).

To avoid these problems, follow these planting tips:


	Water tomato plants regularly, but not excessively;
	Water at the end of the day, when the sun's rays are no longer to be feared;
	Avoid wetting foliage and flowers, and water at the foot of the plant;
	Mulch the soil to conserve moisture;
	Use organic preventive treatments: nettle purin, comfrey, etc.


Do tomato plants need pruning?

This variety of tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to elongate, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which will bear flowers and, if fertilized, fruit.

Pruning is not recommended. This can cause open wounds to the tomatoes and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.

Tomato associations

In the vegetable garden, tomatoes enjoy the company of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tagetes and basil, which repel pests and improve yields. However, we advise against combining potatoes and eggplants with tomato plants.

When to pick the Black Crimean tomato?

Harvesting takes place from June to October. This crop offers an abundance of fruit per plant. Its reddish-brown skin encloses a soft, sweet flesh, with a taste similar to that of the Cɶur de Bɶuf tomato, ideal for crudité salads and coulis.

What are the characteristics of the Brandywine Pink tomato?
The Brandywine Pink tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an old-fashioned, mid-season variety from the United States. This indeterminate-growth plant adapts to all types of soil. Its shallow foliage is reminiscent of the potato. This variety produces large, flattened, slightly ribbed, pinkish-red fruits with dense, juicy flesh.
How to sow Brandywine Pink tomato seeds?
Brandywine tomato seeds can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature between 16 and 20°C.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
Transplant into pots when tomatoes reach the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root system development and keep the plants out of the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clump into the ground in full sunlight, after the last frosts (ice saints in May). Plants destined for greenhouses can be planted when the indoor temperature no longer falls below 10°C;
Keep a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.

We recommend planting companion plants such as tagetes or basil between tomatoes, to repel pests.
Like all tomatoes, Brandywine is susceptible to mildew (a fungus caused by excess humidity) and to apical necrosis (a deficiency caused by irregular watering of the plants). To avoid these problems, water the plants regularly and avoid wetting the tomato leaves. Organic preventive treatments are also available: nettle purin, comfrey, etc.
Do tomato plants need pruning?
Brandywine Pink tomatoes have an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to elongate, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers.
Pruning tomatoes is not recommended. This can cause open wounds and lead to disease. It is, however, possible to keep these voluminous plants in cages or on ladders.
When to harvest Brandywine Pink tomatoes?
These tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This crop produces fruit over a long period. This variety is particularly suited to making juices, coulis and cold soups.

Characteristics of the Anna Russian pink tomato

The Anna Russian pink tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an old mid-season variety from Russia. It was introduced in the 1989 Seed Savers Exchange Yearbook by Craig LeHoullier. Resistant to cool climates, this indeterminate-growing plant adapts to all types of soil. It produces large, reddish-pink, ox-heart-shaped fruits measuring around 7 cm in diameter and weighing up to 250 g. Their dense flesh contains few seeds, is sweet and juicy, with excellent flavor, and is enjoyed raw or cooked.

How to grow the Anna Russian pink tomato?

Russian tomato seedlings can be sown from the end of February in a greenhouse until April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature between 16 and 20°C.


	Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
	Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
	Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
	As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into full sun after the last frosts. Plants intended for greenhouses can be planted when the temperature inside no longer falls below 10°C;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water the tomato abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.


Although vigorous, this Russian variety can be affected by diseases such as mildew (a fungus generally caused by excess humidity) and blight.s d'humidité) and apical necrosis (due to mineral deficiencies caused by irregular watering of the plants). To avoid these problems, be sure to water the plants regularly and avoid wetting the tomato leaves. Organic preventive treatments are also available: nettle purin, comfrey, etc.

We recommend planting companion plants such as tagetes or basil between tomatoes to repel pests.

How often should I water my tomato plants?

To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew and blossom end necrosis, follow these tips:


	Water tomato plants regularly, but not excessively;
	Water at the end of the day, when the sun's rays are no longer to be feared;
	Avoid wetting foliage and flowers, and water at the foot of the plants;
	Mulch the soil to conserve moisture.


Do tomato plants need pruning?

This variety of tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to elongate, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers.

Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the plants and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.

,"The Téton de Vénus tomato is a variety with drooping foliage that produces bright-red, pointed heart-shaped fruits weighing 70-300 g on slender stems. Suitable for drying, they contain few seeds and have melting flesh.
Characteristics of the Téton de Vénus tomato
The Téton de Vénus tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an old mid-season variety from Italy. It owes its name to its distinctive ""oxheart"" shape, which is round and slightly elongated, ending in a pointed tip. Its red fruits, weighing from 70 to 300 g, contain firm, dense flesh with a mild, sweet flavor and melt-in-the-mouth texture.
Téton de Vénus tomato seedlings
Téton de Vénus tomatoes can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature between 16 and 20°C.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Greenhouse plants can be transplanted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
Keep a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.

Tomato plant care
The Téton de Vénus tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem continues to lengthen, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers. Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the tomatoes and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.
To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew or apical necrosis, we recommend regular, but not excessive, watering of tomato plants, without wetting the leaves or flowers. You can also mulch the soil to conserve moisture, and use organic preventive treatments such as nettle purin and comfrey.
Tomato companion plants
In the vegetable garden, tomatoes enjoy the company of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tagetes and basil, which repel pests and improve yields. However, we advise against combining potatoes and eggplants with tomato plants.
Harvesting Venus Teton tomatoes
These tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This is a crop that offers an abundance of fruit per plant in one season. Raw, they are delicious in carpaccio with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil. Cooked, it can be stuffed or puréed. Its abundant, not very juicy flesh makes for a creamy sauce. This tomato is also suitable for drying.

What are the characteristics of the Andean horned tomato?
The Andean horned tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an ancient variety native to South America. It produces elongated, chili-shaped fruits with firm flesh renowned for its excellent taste. Semi-determinate in growth, this mid-season tomato variety is highly productive.
When to plant the Andean horned tomato?
Cornue des Andes tomatoes can be sown from February to April, in pots or trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C. Harvest from June to October.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seedlings and keep the substrate moist;
Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a heated greenhouse;
Transplant into pots when tomato plants reach the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the tomatoes out of the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomatoes outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
As soon as the plants are strong, after the last frosts (ice saints in May), transplant the whole clump in full sun. Tomatoes destined for greenhouses can be planted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between tomato plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomato plants regularly after planting, without wetting the leaves and flowers.

What are the Andean horned tomato's diseases?
Like all tomatoes in the vegetable garden, the Andean Cornue variety is susceptible to mildew (due to humidity) and to apical necrosis (generally due to irregular watering). Carefully remove affected leaves and fruit to prevent the disease spreading to other tomato plants.
The best way to avoid downy mildew is to limit the accumulation of humidity by :

Growing tomatoes under ventilated cover or in a sunny location;
Maintaining sufficient distance between tomato plants;
Mulching or staking to prevent foliage from touching the ground;

There are also organic preventive treatments: comfrey, nettle purin...
To maintain a healthy crop, we recommend planting companion plants between tomatoes. Oregon Lei Mix tagetes and Anis basil keep pests away from the plantation.
Is it necessary to prune Andean horned tomatoes?
Tomato pruning consists in removing the gourmands, the secondary shoots that have not yet produced flowers. This technique was introduced by professional market gardeners to speed up productivity and facilitate harvesting.
We do not recommend pruning tomatoes, however, as it can cause wounds and lead to disease, not to mention the energy required by the plants to heal.

What are the characteristics of the Roma Paste tomato?
The Roma Paste tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is a mid-season variety first recorded in 1800 and originally from Rome, Italy. This indeterminate-growing plant produces elongated red fruits with firm, sweet flesh. This Roman tomato is ideal for preserves and sauces.
How to grow Roma Paste tomatoes?
Roma Paste tomatoes can be sown from February to April, in pots or trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seedlings and keep the substrate moist;
Set up tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
Transplant into pots when plants reach the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the tomatoes away from the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomatoes outside during the day to acclimatize them to the outdoors;
As soon as the plants are strong, transplant the whole clump into the ground in full sunlight, after the last frosts (ice saints in May). Tomatoes intended for greenhouses can be planted when the indoor temperature no longer falls below 10°C;
Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomato plants regularly after planting, without wetting the leaves and flowers.

It may be a good idea to plant companion plants between tomatoes, such as Tangerine tagetes or lemon basil, to repel pests.
How often should I water my tomato plants?

To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew and blossom end necrosis, follow these tips:
Water tomato plants regularly, but not excessively;
Water at the end of the day, when the sun's rays are no longer to be feared;
Avoid wetting foliage and flowers, and water at the foot of the plants;
Mulch the soil to conserve moisture.

Do tomato plants need pruning?
This variety of tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to elongate, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers.
Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds on the tomatoes and lead to disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.
When to harvest Roma Paste tomatoes?
Roma Paste tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This highly productive variety can produce several kilos of fruit per plant in a single season.

Characteristics of the Coeur de Bœuf de Nice tomato

The Cœur de Bœuf de Nice tomato, or 'Cuor di Bue', Solanum lycopersicum, is an old variety from the Nice region of France. Its red, slightly elongated, pear-shaped fruits can weigh from 200 to 300g. Their dense, flavorful flesh, low in seeds, is best enjoyed raw.

How to grow the Coeur de Bœuf de Nice tomato?

Nice Coeur de Bœuf tomatoes can be sown from the end of February in greenhouses, and up to April in pots or containers.They can be sown from the end of February in a greenhouse to April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C.


	Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
	Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
	Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
	As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Plants destined for greenhouses can be planted when the indoor temperature no longer falls below 10°C;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.


What combinations are there with tomatoes?

In the vegetable garden, tomatoes enjoy the company of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tagetes and basil, which repel pests and improve yields. However, we advise against combining potatoes and eggplants with tomato plants.

How to care for a Coeur de Bœuf tomato plant?

The Cœur de Bœuf de Nice tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to lengthen, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers. Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the tomatoes and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.

To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew or apical necrosis, we recommend regular, but not excessive, watering of tomato plants, without wetting the leaves or flowers. You can also mulch the soil to conserve moisture, and use organic preventive treatments such as nettle purin and comfrey.

When to harvest the Coeur de Bœuf de Nice tomato?

Nice Coeur de Bœuf tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This crop offers an abundance of fruit per plant throughout the season. With its dense, fragrant and slightly sweet flesh, this tomato can be used in a wide range of recipes, but it's best eaten raw, with a drizzle of olive oil.

Violet Jasper black tomato seedlings can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature between 16 and 20°C.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
Place tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
Transplant into a pot when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants out of the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Greenhouse plants can be transplanted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
Keep a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.

In the vegetable garden, purple tomatoes enjoy the company of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tagetes and basil, which repel pests and improve yields. However, we advise against combining potatoes and eggplants with tomatoes.
How to care for purple tomatoes in the garden?
This variety of tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem continues to lengthen, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers. Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the tomatoes and encourage the spread of disease. Install sturdy stakes or cages to support these bulky plants.
To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew or apical necrosis, we recommend regular, but not excessive, watering of tomatoes, without wetting foliage or flowers. You can also mulch the soil to conserve moisture, and use organic preventive treatments such as nettle purin and comfrey.
When to pick purple tomatoes?
Purple tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This crop produces an abundance of ""cocktail tomato"" fruits. They can be eaten raw, in salads or carpaccio, or cooked or candied.

Characteristics of the Bosque Blue indigo tomato

The Bosque Blue indigo tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is a new variety developed after 5 years of breeding by Lee Goodwin in New Mexico. It is the result of a cross between the ""Blue"" tomato from the University of Oregon and the ""Amy's Sugar Gem"" variety. This mid-season plant of indeterminate growth offers a multitude of round fruits weighing 60 to 90 g, whose dark blue-purple color reveals the presence of anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants. Lee Goodwin evokes a vanilla flavor for his first indigo tomato variety.

Bosque Blue indigo tomato seedlings

Blue tomato seedlings can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or honeycombed trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C.


	Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
	Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
	Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
	As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Plants destined for greenhouses can be planted when the indoor temperature no longer falls below 10°C;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.


We recommend planting companion plants such as tagetes or basil between tomatoes to repel pests.

How often should I water my tomato plants?

To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew and blossom end necrosis, follow these tips:


	Water tomato plants regularly, but not excessively;
	Water at the end of the day, when the sun's rays are no longer to be feared;
	Avoid wetting tomato leaves and flowers by watering at the foot of the plant;
	Mulch the soil to conserve moisture;
	Use organic preventive treatments: nettle purin, comfrey, etc.


Is it necessary to prune tomato plants?

This blue tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to elongate, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers.

Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the plants and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.

When to harvest the Bosque Blue indigo tomato?

,"This vigorous tomato variety bears clusters of elongated red fruit, 6 to 7 cm long. San Marzano is resistant to shattering, suitable for drying and making tomato preserves and sauces. Its firm, dense flesh has a mild flavor.

What are the characteristics of the San Marzano mid-season red tomato?

The San Marzano red tomato (from the Latin Solanum lycopersicum) is a mid-season variety from Italy. Introduced into Glecklers Seedmen's Tomato and Strange Plant Emporium catalog in 1958, it is now popular in the preparation of tomato sauces. Highly resistant to disease and shattering, San Marzano adapts well to all types of soil. This indeterminate-growth variety produces elongated red fruits with firm flesh.

How to sow San Marzano tomato seeds?

San Marzano red tomato seeds should be sown in pots or trays, under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C. Sow between February and April.


	Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
	Water seedlings thoroughly;
	Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a heated greenhouse;
	Transplant into pots when plants reach the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants out of the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to the outdoors;
	As soon as the plants are strong, transplant the whole clump into the ground in full sunlight, after the last frosts (ice saints in May). Greenhouse plants can be transplanted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
	Keep a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water tomatoes regularly after planting, without touching foliage or flowers.


How to grow San Marzano tomatoes?

Although vigorous, the San Marzano red tomato variety can be affected by diseases such as downy mildew or apical necrosis, also known as black-bottom.

The most widespread disease, downy mildew, is a fungus in the form of brown spots that appears on the foliage and then on the stem. Downy mildew occurs particularly in wet summers. The best way to avoid it is to limit the accumulation of humidity by :


	Tomatoes under ventilated shelter or sunny exposure;
	Sufficient distance between tomato plants;
	Mulching or staking to prevent lower leaves from touching the ground.


Comfrey purin can also be used as a preventive treatment.

The second problem is caused by irregular watering of plants, leading to mineral deficiency. Apical necrosis appears as black spots on the tips of the fruit. Remove those affected and resume regular, but not excessive, watering.

To boost the immune defenses of San Marzano tomatoes and protect them from fungal diseases, we recommend using horsetail decoction and nettle manure. Combining the crop with companion plants such as basil is another way of keeping pests at bay.

How to store and eat San Marzano tomatoes?

San Marzano red tomatoes are harvested from June to October. The fruits, renowned for their mild flavor and firm flesh, contain few seeds. This vegetable can be eaten both raw and cooked, but many people use them to make sauces, juices and canned coulis. Be sure to sterilize glass jars by immersing them in boiling water before pouring in the tomatoes.

Characteristics of the Russian Giant red tomato

The Russian Giant red tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is a late variety native to Russia. It produces red, round, ribbed fruits weighing 300 to 600 g. Their firm, juicy, sweet flesh can be eaten raw, in carpaccio, or cooked, in sauce or stuffed.

When to plant Russian Giant red tomatoes?

Russian Giant red tomatoes can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or honeycombed trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C.


	Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
	Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
	Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
	As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into full sun after the last frosts. Plants intended for greenhouses can be planted when the temperature inside no longer falls below 10°C;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water the tomato abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.


How to care for a Russian red tomato plant?

Although vigorous, this Russian variety can be affected by diseases such as mildew (a fungus generally caused by excess humidity) and blight.s d'humidité) and apical necrosis (due to mineral deficiencies caused by irregular watering).

To avoid these problems, follow these tips:


	Water tomato plants regularly, but not excessively;
	Water at the end of the day, when the sun's rays are no longer to be feared;
	Avoid wetting foliage and flowers, and water at the foot of the plants;
	Mulch the soil to conserve moisture;
	Use organic preventive treatments: nettle purin, comfrey, etc.


What to grow with tomatoes

In the vegetable garden, tomatoes enjoy the company of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tagetes and basil, which repel pests and improve yields. However, we advise against combining potatoes and eggplants with tomato plants.

Do tomato plants need pruning?

This variety of tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to elongate, forming numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers.

Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the plants and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.

When to harvest Russian Giant red tomatoes?

Russian Giant red tomatoes are harvested from July to October. This highly productive crop regularly produces fruit well into the season. In the kitchen, its dense, sweet and juicy flesh can be enjoyed in sauces, purées, stuffed in the oven or simply raw in salads.

,"Characteristics of the Merveille des Marchés tomato
The Merveille des Marchés tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an old mid-season variety from France. It is mentioned in Vilmorin-Andrieux's 1885 book Les Plantes Potagères. Its round, smooth, red fruits, weighing 130 to 180 g and resistant to shattering, contain pink, fragrant flesh ideal for stuffed vegetable recipes. With its smooth, very thin skin, this variety is also ideal for making sauces and coulis.
Merveille des Marchés tomato seedlings
Merveille des Marchés tomatoes can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature between 16 and 20°C.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
Grow tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
Transplant into pots when the tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the plants protected from the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into the vegetable garden, in full sun, after the last frosts. Greenhouse plants can be transplanted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
Keep a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomatoes abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.

Tomato plant care
The Merveille des Marchés tomato has an indeterminate growth habit. The stem will continue to lengthen and form numerous lateral branches, all of which produce flowers. Pruning is not recommended. Pruning can cause open wounds to the tomatoes and encourage the spread of disease. For staking, these bulky plants can be kept in cages or on ladders.
To avoid fungal diseases such as mildew or apical necrosis, we recommend regular, but not excessive, watering of tomato plants, without wetting the leaves or flowers. You can also mulch the soil to conserve moisture, and use organic preventive treatments such as nettle purin and comfrey.
Tomato companion plants
In the vegetable garden, tomatoes enjoy the company of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tagetes and basil, which repel pests and improve yields. However, we advise against combining potatoes and eggplants with tomato plants.
Harvesting Merveille des Marchés tomatoes
These tomatoes are harvested from June to October. This is a crop that offers an abundance of fruit per plant in one season. Raw or cooked, this variety lends itself to both salads and stuffed dishes. Its pink, fragrant flesh goes well with sunny vegetables, meats and fish.

What are the characteristics of the Vesuvius tomato?
The Vesuvius tomato or Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, Solanum lycopersicum, is an ancient variety native to Campania in Italy. It is traditionally grown on the dark, fertile slopes of Vesuvius. This mid-season variety has an indeterminate growth habit. Its red fruits weigh between 20 and 30 g and end in a point, with thick skin and not very juicy flesh. In Naples, these small, sweet cherry tomatoes are tied in bunches and hung from the ceiling in a dry, ventilated place. They will keep for 6 months over winter.
How to sow Vesuvius tomato seeds?
Vesuvius tomato seeds can be sown from February to April, in pots or trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C.

Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
Water the seeds abundantly;
Grow tomatoes indoors under a source of light or in a heated greenhouse;
Transplant into pots for the first time when the tomato plants reach the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root development and keep the tomatoes out of the cold;
For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomatoes outside during the day to acclimatize them to the outdoors;
As soon as the plants are strong, transplant the whole clump into the ground in full sunlight, after the last frosts (ice saints in May). Tomatoes destined for greenhouses can be planted when the indoor temperature no longer falls below 10°C;
Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between tomato plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
Water tomato plants regularly after planting, without wetting the leaves and flowers.

To maintain a healthy crop, we recommend planting companion plants between tomatoes. Oregon Lei Mix tagetes and lemon basil keep pests away from the plantation.
How to store Vesuvius tomatoes?
These small Italian tomatoes are harvested from June to October. To eat the dried fruit all winter long, hang them in bunches in a dry, well-ventilated place. This variety is also used to make tomato sauce.
How to eat Vesuvius tomatoes
This cherry tomato can be eaten raw or cooked, as an aperitif, in salad or soup. In Italy, its sweet flavor is used to season pasta, fish and meat dishes.

Characteristics of the Poire Rouge cherry tomato

The Red Pear cherry tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is an old, early variety from France. It was introduced before 1865 and is mentioned in Vilmorin-Andrieux's 1883 book Les Plantes Potagères. This cherry tomato has an indeterminate growth habit and adapts to all types of soil. It produces clusters of small, pear-shaped, red fruits. Their firm, juicy flesh has an excellent sweet flavor, and is equally appreciated as an aperitif or preserved.

Red Pear cherry tomato seedlings

Red Pear cherry tomatoes can be sown from the end of February under glass until April, in pots or in trays, under a very bright shelter and at a temperature of between 16 and 20°C.


	Bury seeds 5-7 mm deep in potting soil;
	Water the seedlings, but do not over-water;
	Grow cherry tomatoes indoors under a light source or in a nursery;
	Transplant into pots for the first time when the cherry tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root system development, and keep the plants protected from the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
	As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into full sun after the last frosts. Greenhouse plants can be planted when indoor temperatures no longer fall below 10°C;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water the cherry tomato abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.


Although vigorous, the Poire Rouge cherry tomato variety can be affected by diseases such as downy mildew (a fungus generally caused by to excess humidity) and apical necrosis (due to mineral deficiencies caused by irregular watering of the plants). To avoid these problems, be sure to water the plants regularly, without over-watering, and avoid wetting the tomato leaves. Organic preventive treatments are also available: nettle purin, comfrey, etc.

We recommend planting companion plants such as tagetes or basil between tomatoes to repel pests.

Harvesting Poire Rouge cherry tomatoes

This early variety is harvested from June to October. This crop offers an abundance of fruit clusters throughout the summer. With its mild, slightly sweet flavor, this red cherry tomato garnishes salads, pies, soups and aperitif platters, and can also be stored in sterilized jars.

	Transplant into pots for the first time when the cherry tomato reaches the stage of 2 to 4 true leaves. Bury the stem up to the two cotyledons to encourage root system development, and keep the plants protected from the cold;
	For 4 to 7 days before planting, take the tomato plants outside during the day to acclimatize them to outdoor conditions;
	As soon as the tomatoes are strong, transplant the whole clod into full sun after the last frosts. Plants intended for greenhouses can be planted when the temperature inside no longer falls below 10°C;
	Maintain a minimum distance of 50 cm between plants, burying the stem up to the first leaves;
	Water the cherry tomato abundantly when planting in the vegetable garden.


We recommend planting companion plants such as tagetes or basil between the tomatoes to repel pests.

Although vigorous, the Early Cherry red cherry tomato variety can be affected by diseases such as mildew (a fungus generally caused by to excess humidity) and apical necrosis (due to mineral deficiencies caused by irregular watering of the plants). To avoid these problems, be sure to water the plants regularly and avoid wetting the tomato leaves. Organic preventive treatments are also available: nettle purin, comfrey, etc.

Harvesting the Early Cherry red cherry tomato

This very early variety is harvested from May to October. This crop produces an abundance of fruit in bunches over a period of 3 to 4 weeks. Mild in flavor, this cocktail-type red cherry tomato is delicious raw, as an aperitif or in salads.

Sowing Pleine de Naples squash

Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow directly in the garden in 2 to 3-seed stacks.

Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

Place a crate or tile under the fruit, without damaging it, to isolate it from the soil and prevent rotting.

To encourage the development of squash, combine companion plants such as corn and beans (milpa). Plant basil between all types of squash to repel pests.

Harvesting and storing Full Naples squash

Although the fruits of these squashes can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk begins to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to tear them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This variety will keep for up to 1 year in a ventilated, dry place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in crates set high up. They can also be frozen for up to a year, after slicing and cooking.

What are the characteristics of the Sucrine du Berry squash?

Sucrine du Berry or Sucrette du Berry squash, Cucurbita moschata, is a late-ripening variety of French origin. Its 15 to 25 cm fruits are pear-shaped, with green skin that turns ochre when ripe. Both the flowers and the sweet, fragrant orange flesh are delicious, adapting to all kinds of savory and sweet recipes: soup, velouté, purée, gratin, pie...

How to sow Sucrine du Berry squash seeds?

Sucrine du Berry squash can be sown from February to May in pots of 2 or 3 seeds, and from March to June in the ground.

Sowing in pots is done 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting. Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Seeds should be kept moist and warm, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, until they emerge.

For direct sowing, wait until the last frosts have passed and choose a sunny spot. In the garden, prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate Sucrine du Berry squash plants or seeds. To encourage taller growth and free up ground space, install sturdy supports when transplanting the seedlings.

What companion plants should I grow with Sucrine du Berry squash?

Sucrine du Berry squash goes very well with corn and beans, forming the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. These complementary plants produce beneficial effects that benefit their neighbors. We also recommend planting basil between all types of squash to repel pests.

How to store Sucrine du Berry squash?

Sucrine du Berry squash is harvested between July and November, before the first frosts. Drying out of the stalks indicates that the fruit is ready to detach from the plant. Be careful not to tear off the squash, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This winter variety keeps for 4 to 6 months in a ventilated, dry place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Elevate squash on crates, well spaced out and tail up. They can also be frozen for up to a year, after slicing and cooking. Their musky orange flesh can be enjoyed in a variety of recipes. Its mild flavor goes perfectly with apples, pears and spices like cinnamon.

,"The Carat squash is a runner variety with smooth, fairly round, beige fruits weighing 1 to 2 kg and a particularly delicious orange flesh. Also known as ""Mini-Muscade de Provence"".
Characteristics of Carat moschata squash
Carat squash, also known as ""Mini-Muscade de Provence"", Cucurbita moschata, is a runner variety of fruiting vegetable, ideal for growing in a small vegetable garden. Smaller than the Musquée de Provence squash, its smooth, round, beige fruits weigh less than 2 kg and keep for several months. Their tasty orange flesh can be enjoyed stuffed or puréed, in quiche and soup recipes. The flowers are also edible.
Sowing Carat moschata squash
Carat moschata squash is sown in pots 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting, from March to May, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds.
Place seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.
From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow directly in the garden in 2 to 3-seed stacks.
Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.
Place a crate or tile under the fruit, without damaging it, to isolate it from the soil and prevent rotting.
To encourage the development of squash, combine companion plants such as corn and beans (milpa). Plant basil between all types of squash to repel pests.
Harvesting and storing Carat squash
Although Carat squash fruits can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk begins to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to tear them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.
This squash will keep for 6 to 8 months in a ventilated, dry place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in crates set high up. They can also be frozen for up to a year, after slicing and cooking.
Carat squash recipes
In the kitchen, Carat squash can be enjoyed sweet or savory, in soup or gratin. There's no shortage of recipe ideas for enjoying its delicious flavor. In a leek and goat's cheese quiche, a potato velouté or as a squash stuffed with salt and pepper, it reveals its melting orange flesh. It goes perfectly with other vegetables, cheeses and mushrooms.

,"Green watermelon with red seeds for jam is a very old variety of watermelon, traditionally used for jams.

Characteristics of green watermelon for jam with red seeds

Citrullus lanatus is a very old variety, traditionally used for jam, particularly in the Vendée region and southern France. Also known as ""Gigérine"" and ""Citre à confire"", this watermelon was introduced in Vilmorin-Andrieux's 1883 book Les Plantes Potagères. This mid-season variety produces spherical, light-green fruits with grayish green mottled stripes, 30 to 40 cm in diameter, with juicy, sweet, greenish-white flesh and pink or red seeds.

Sowing green watermelon with red seeds for candying

Green watermelon is sown in pots 6 to 8 weeks before transplanting, from March to April, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds. Place seedlings under a bright, warm shelter, at a temperature above 21°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to May, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow directly in the garden in 2 to 3-seed stacks.

Prepare holes filled with compost or organic matter 2 weeks in advance, spaced 1.50 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the watermelon plants or seeds. Water freshly transplanted seedlings regularly, avoiding wetting the foliage, and mulch the soil to keep it cool and limit water evaporation.

To encourage height growth and free up space on the ground, install sturdy supports when transplanting the plants. In cooler regions, we recommend warming the soil with mulch before planting, and leaving only one to three fruits per plant to encourage ripening.

In the vegetable garden, watermelon enjoys the company of potatoes, leeks and onions.

Harvesting green watermelon with red seeds for preserving

Green watermelon with red seeds is harvested from July to October, when the fruit is heavy and the tendril opposite the stalk is dry. Be careful not to tear off the fruit, but to cut it as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk. Watermelons do not ripen after picking. It can be stored for several days in a cool, dark place, or made into jam.

Characteristics of the watermelon Moon and Stars - Lune-Étoiles Amish

The Moon and Stars watermelon, Citrullus lanatus, is a variety of fruiting vegetable native to the United States. It is probably a variant of the ""Sun, Moon and Stars"" watermelon proposed by Henderson in 1920, and reintroduced in 1987 by the Seed Savers Exchange. This runner variety owes its name to its elongated fruits, weighing from 6 to 12 kg, spotted with moon and yellow stars. Their thick green skin encloses sweet red flesh and brown seeds.

Moon and Stars watermelon seedlings - Lune-Étoiles Amish

Moon and Stars watermelons are sown in pots of 2 to 3 seeds, 6 to 8 weeks before transplanting, from March to April. Place seedlings under a bright, warm shelter, at a temperature above 21°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Transplant watermelons to the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed. From April to May, after the last risk of frost, it's possible to sow directly in the garden in stacks of 2 to 3 seeds.

Prepare holes filled with compost or organic matter 2 weeks in advance, spaced 1.50 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the watermelon plants or seeds. In cooler regions, it's advisable to warm the soil with mulch before planting, and to leave only one to three fruits per plant to encourage the ripening process. To encourage height growth and free up space on the ground, install sturdy supports when transplanting the plants.

Water freshly transplanted seedlings regularly, avoiding wetting the foliage, and mulch the soil to keep it cool and limit water evaporation. In the vegetable garden, watermelon enjoys the company of potatoes, leeks and onions.

Harvesting Moon and Stars watermelon - Lune-Étoiles Amish

Moon and Stars watermelons are harvested from July to October, when the fruit is heavy and the tendril opposite the stalk is dry. Be careful not to tear off the fruit, but cut as close to the stem as possible, 10 cm above the stalk. Watermelons do not ripen after picking. They can be stored for several days in a cool, dark place.

,"This creeping or climbing species produces cylindrical fruits 20 to 40 cm long. Much appreciated in Asian cuisine, the young fruits are eaten like zucchini. The fibers of the ripe, dried fruit serve as a vegetable sponge.

This plant, native to India, is also known as ""vegetable squash"" or ""vegetable sponge"".

What are the characteristics of the Luffa cylindrica plant?

The Luffa cylindrica plant is a species of runner or climbing gourd in the Cucurbitaceae family, native to India. It forms a vigorous vine with tendrils and produces long, green fruits 20 to 40 cm long, with fibrous, white flesh. Although they can be picked very young for use in cooking, they are mainly cultivated for domestic and therapeutic use, hence the name ""vegetable sponge gourd"". They remove dirt and dead skin and promote blood circulation. In this case, the fruits are harvested ripe for drying.

When and how to sow Luffa cylindrica - Vegetable Sponge seeds?

Luffa seeds are sown from March to April in pots on the surface, but can also be placed directly in the ground once the garden soil has warmed up. This plant can take up to 200 days to grow, and requires constant warmth. It stops growing if the temperature drops below 15°C, and dies at 5°C.

Soak Luffa seeds in lukewarm water for 24 hours to facilitate germination. Place the cups indoors under a light source or in a heated greenhouse, at a minimum temperature of 18°C. Keep the substrate moist until the Luffa seeds have emerged. Transplant into rich, well-drained soil, in the garden or greenhouse, when plants have 4-5 true leaves and temperatures no longer drop below 15°C.

For direct sowing, wait until after the last frosts and choose a sunny spot. Space plants at least 1 m apart in all directions. To obtain beautiful vegetable sponges, place a trellis at the time of transplanting.

When to harvest Luffa cylindrica - Vegetable sponge?

Harvesting takes place from July to November. If intended for cooking, the fruit can be prepared in the same way as cucumbers or zucchinis: raw, sautéed, steamed or in soup. To be eaten, the fruit must be picked very young and green, when it is less than 15 cm long. Once split, it becomes too bitter and is best used to make a vegetable sponge.

How do I make a Luffa sponge?

To make a sponge, Luffa squash must be picked when ripe, when the stalk dries out and the skin turns brown. They then give off a dry sound when shaken. You can also wait for temperatures to drop below 10°C. Be careful not to tear off the fruit, but cut as close as possible to the stem.


	Dry the empty squash in a dry, well-ventilated place;
	Cut off one end to release the Luffa seeds;
	Remove the brown skin from the fruit.


Simply dampen the resulting sponge to take advantage of its exfoliating properties. Rinse and leave to dry after each use.

How do I harvest Luffa seeds - Vegetable sponge?

Luffa seeds are harvested when the fruit is ripe. Simply open and shake the fruit to collect the seeds. One gram of seed contains around 20 seeds. Germination of this squash is slow and sporadic if optimum conditions are not met. The average germination period is 5 years.",
,"This white-seeded variety produces cylindrical fruits 20 to 40 cm long. When young, they can be eaten like zucchini. The fibers of ripe, dried fruit act as a vegetable sponge.

What are the characteristics of Siam squash?

A cucurbit native to Mexico, the Siam or ""Tzilicayotli"" squash, Cucurbitaficifolia, first appeared in Europe in the early 19th century. The term ficifolia means ""fig leaves"", in reference to the shape of its foliage. This highly productive mid-season variety can produce up to 15 fruits, whose marble-green color and ovoid shape are reminiscent of watermelon. In the kitchen, its soft white flesh unravels into vermicelli-like strands (just like spaghetti squash).

This gelatinous perennial lives for several years in certain protected areas on the Côte d'Azur, and can be grown as an annual in other regions. The stems then lignify, retaining their high productivity.

How to grow Siamese gourd?

Siam squash can be sown from February to April in pots of 3 or 4 seeds, or from March to May in the ground.

If you choose to sow in pots, sow 2 to 3 weeks before planting out in the garden. Water lightly to keep the soil moist, and place seedlings at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C.

To sow directly in the ground, wait until the last frosts have passed, when the soil has warmed up. In the garden, prepare holes filled with compost or organic matter 2 weeks in advance, spaced 1.50 to 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash seedlings. This elusive plant can grow up to 15 m long and cover the garden. Install sturdy supports, such as a trellis, to enable it to grow on them and free up space in the vegetable garden.

Include companion plants in your squash planting to encourage flower and fruit growth while keeping pests at bay. Choose basil or beans, for example.

When to pick Siam squash?

This variety is harvested from June to October. Drying out of the stalks indicates that the fruits are ready to detach from the plants, but they don't need to be ripe to be eaten. Be careful not to pull out the squash, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

How to store Siam squash?

If stored in good conditions, Siam squash can last up to 2 years. Choose a well-ventilated, dry location, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail upwards, in high crates. They can also be frozen, after slicing and cooking.

How to cook Siam squash?

Like all squashes, this variety can be cooked in a variety of ways: in sauerkraut, soup, fritters, gratin... Its white, stringy flesh is used in a number of delicious recipes, but it is best appreciated in jam. Also known as ""angel hair"", this Spanish specialty is used to garnish cakes and croustades.",

,"The Melonnette Jaspée de Vendée squash is a very old variety that produces 5 to 7 yellow-orange fruits, round and cracked like a melon, up to 20 cm in diameter and weighing up to 3 kg. Their thick, orange flesh has a very sweet taste.
Characteristics of the Melonnette Jaspée de Vendée squash
The Melonnette Jaspée de Vendée squash, Cucurbita pepo, is a very old variety of runner, native to France. Also known as ""Melonnette de Saint Julien de Concelles"" and ""Winter squash"", it offers 5 to 7 yellow-orange fruits, 15 to 20 cm in diameter, with the appearance of an embroidered melon. Their thick, sweet orange flesh is excellent for eating raw, grated or cooked in purées, soups, tarts or desserts. Squash flowers are also edible.
How to sow Melonnette Jaspée de Vendée squash?
Melonnette Jaspée de Vendée squash is sown in pots, from March to May, 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds.
Place seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.
From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow the seeds directly in the garden in stacks of 2 to 3 seeds.
Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.
Next to the squash, we recommend sowing corn and beans, giving rise to the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. Basil plants can also be planted to repel pests.
Harvesting the Jaspée de Vendée squash
Although the fruits of the Jaspée de Vendée squash can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk starts to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to tear them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.
How to store Jaspée de Vendée squash
Jaspée de Vendée squash can be stored all winter in a dry, well-ventilated place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruits, spaced apart and with their tails facing upwards, in high crates. They can also be frozen, after slicing and cooking, to keep for up to a year. In the kitchen, this pretty, plump squash is equally at home in savoury and sweet recipes. Raw, its crunchy flesh reveals subtle notes of hazelnut and a hint of orange, ideal in a poké bowl or grated into a salad. Cooked, it softens for a sweeter taste. It can then be prepared in vegetable soups, purées, pan-fried dishes or desserts.

,"Sweet Dumpling is a variety that produces 4 to 10 fruits weighing 300 to 800 g, ivory in color with green stripes. Their firm, yellow-orange flesh has a chestnut and hazelnut flavor. They keep for 3 to 6 months.

Characteristics of Sweet Dumpling squash

Sweet Dumpling squash, Cucurbita pepo, is a highly decorative vegetable plant native to the United States. Also known as Patidou squash, this runner variety produces 4 to 10 ribbed fruits, 15 to 25 cm in diameter and weighing up to 800 g, with ivory skin streaked with green. Their firm, sweet, orange-yellow flesh is reminiscent of chestnuts and hazelnuts. Enjoy them raw, grated into salads, or cooked in purées, soups, gratins or stuffed in the oven. Squash flowers are also edible.

Successful Sweet Dumpling seedlings

Sweet Dumpling squash is sown from March to May, 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting, in pots of 2 to 3 seeds.

Place seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow the seeds directly in the garden in stacks of 2 to 3 seeds.

Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

Next to the squash, we recommend sowing corn and beans, giving rise to the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. Basil plants can also be planted to repel pests.

Patidou squash harvesting

Although Patidou squash fruits can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk begins to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to tear them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

Patidou squash can be stored all winter in a dry, well-ventilated place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in crates set high up. They can also be frozen, after slicing and cooking, to keep for up to a year.

Patidou squash recipes

Beneath its attractively striped skin, Patidou squash stands out for its pronounced taste of chestnut and hazelnut. Its orange, slightly sweet flesh has given life to many recipes. Grated raw in salads, it goes perfectly with carrots and avocados. Cooked, it can be prepared in soups, purées, tarts or gratins, but it reveals all its potential in an egg casserole or stuffed in the oven.

What are the characteristics of Jack O'Lantern squash?

Jack O'Lantern squash, Cucurbita pepo, is a mid-season runner native to the United States. It is the famous carved pumpkin of Halloween. It bears up to 5 fruits per plant, each measuring up to 30 cm in diameter. Their ribbed skin encloses a thick, light-orange, slightly sweet flesh, ideal for soups or gratins.

A smaller version exists, with pumpkins 5 to 8 cm in diameter: Jack Be Little squash.

How do I grow Jack O'Lantern squash?

Squash seedlings are sown from February to May in pots of 2 to 3 seeds, under a light shelter, and from March to June in the open ground.

Sowing in pots should take place 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting. Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. The seeds should be kept moist and warm, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, until they emerge.

To sow directly in the ground, wait until the last frosts have passed and choose a sunny spot. Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

In the garden, squash enjoys the company of corn and beans, giving rise to the cultivation of the three sisters or milpa. Also plant basil to repel pests.

How to store Jack O'Lantern squash?

Jack O'Lantern squash is harvested between June and November, before the first frost. Drying out of the stalks indicates that the fruit is ready to detach from the plant. Be careful not to tear the squash, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This variety of squash keeps for 4 to 9 months in a ventilated, dry place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in high crates. They can also be frozen for up to a year, after slicing and cooking.

Pomme d'Or squash characteristics

Pomme d'Or squash, Cucurbita pepo, is an ancient variety of fruiting vegetable native to France. Its long stems bear 10 to 20 spherical fruits, 6 to 8 cm in diameter, with smooth skin that turns green and then yellow-orange when ripe. Their yellow, slightly fibrous flesh is pleasantly fragrant. They keep very well and reveal their delicious artichoke flavor in stuffed recipes. Squash flowers are also edible.

How to sow Pomme d'Or squash?

Pomme d'Or squash is sown from March to May in pots, 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds.

Place the seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow the seeds directly in the garden in stacks of 2 to 3 seeds.

Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

Next to the squash, we recommend sowing corn and beans, giving rise to the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. Also plant basil to repel pests.

When to harvest Pomme d'Or squash?

Although Pomme d'Or squash can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk begins to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to tear them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

How to store Pomme d'Or squash?

Pomme d'Or squash can be stored all winter in a dry, well-ventilated place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in high crates. They can also be frozen, after slicing and cooking, to keep for up to a year. Baked au gratin, in vegetable purée or stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, Pomme d'Or squash brighten up winter dishes.

Description of the Mayet white pumpkin

Mayet white pumpkin, Cucurbita maxima, is an old variety from Mayet in France. This squash offers round, flattened, white fruits measuring up to 30 cm in diameter and weighing from 3 to 6 kg. Their dark orange, fibrous flesh is excellent for tarts, gratins, soups and risottos. Pumpkin flowers are also edible.

Blanc de Mayet pumpkin seedlings

Sow in pots 2 to 3 weeks before planting, from March to May, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds.

Place seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow pumpkin seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow directly in the garden in 2 to 3-seed stacks.

Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

Next to the squash, we recommend planting corn and beans, giving rise to the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. Basil plants can also be planted to repel pests.

Harvesting and storing Mayet white pumpkins

Although Blanc de Mayet pumpkin fruits can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk begins to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to tear them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This variety of pumpkin can be stored for several months in a ventilated, dry place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in crates set high up. They can also be frozen for up to a year, after slicing and cooking.

Characteristics of the Gros de Paris yellow pumpkin

The Gros de Paris yellow pumpkin, Cucurbita maxima, is a runner variety of fruiting vegetable native to France, with plants 5 to 6 m long. This squash produces spherical, flattened, ribbed fruits, 25 to 70 cm in diameter and weighing 15 to 50 kg each. Their salmon-yellow skin, embroidered when ripe, encloses thick, tender, yellow-orange flesh with an excellent sweet taste. This pumpkin is delicious in soups, gratins, soufflés and jams. Pumpkin flowers are also edible.

How to grow the Gros de Paris yellow pumpkin?

Be careful not to pull them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This variety of yellow squash can be stored for several months in a dry, well-ventilated place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the pumpkins, spaced apart and tail up, in high crates. They can also be frozen, after slicing and cooking, to keep for up to a year. In the kitchen, yellow pumpkins are delicious in winter soups, soufflés, gratins and jams.

Characteristics of Petit Turban Turc squash

Petit Turban Turc or Bonnet Turc squash, Cucurbita maxima, is an ancient variety of pumpkin native to France. It is a smaller variant of the Turban Turc squash. It produces turban-shaped fruits, 15 to 25 cm in diameter and weighing 100 to 800 g, variegated with orange, green and white. Often decorative, this squashy variety is also appreciated in cooking, for its light-orange flesh, firm and thin, with a sweet flavor. The squash flowers are also edible.

How to sow Petit Turban Turc squash?

Sow in pots 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting, from March to May, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds.

Place seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow squash seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow directly in the garden in 2 to 3-seed stacks.

Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

Near the pumpkins and squash, we recommend sowing corn and beans, giving rise to the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. Also plant basil to repel pests.

When to harvest Turkish bonnet squash?

Although the fruits of the Turk's Bean squash can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk starts to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to pull them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This variety of pumpkin can be stored for several months in a dry, well-ventilated place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in crates set high up, or freeze them, after slicing and cooking, for up to a year's storage. In terms of cooking recipes, this squash can be enjoyed as a soufflé, purée or vegetable soup.

Description of the Mayet white pumpkin

Mayet white pumpkin, Cucurbita maxima, is an old variety from Mayet in France. This squash offers round, flattened, white fruits measuring up to 30 cm in diameter and weighing from 3 to 6 kg. Their dark orange, fibrous flesh is excellent for tarts, gratins, soups and risottos. Pumpkin flowers are also edible.

Blanc de Mayet pumpkin seedlings

Sow in pots 2 to 3 weeks before planting, from March to May, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds.

Place seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow pumpkin seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow directly in the garden in 2 to 3-seed stacks.

Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

Next to the squash, we recommend planting corn and beans, giving rise to the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. Basil plants can also be planted to repel pests.

Harvesting and storing Mayet white pumpkins

Although Blanc de Mayet pumpkin fruits can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those intended for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk begins to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to tear them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This variety of pumpkin can be stored for several months in a ventilated, dry place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the fruit, spaced apart and tail up, in crates set high up. They can also be frozen for up to a year, after slicing and cooking.

Their yellow to salmon-colored skin is cracked or embroidered when ripe. Their yellow-orange flesh is thick, tender and sweet, and keeps for a long time.

Characteristics of the Gros de Paris yellow pumpkin

The Gros de Paris yellow pumpkin, Cucurbita maxima, is a runner variety of fruiting vegetable native to France, with plants 5 to 6 m long. This squash produces spherical, flattened, ribbed fruits, 25 to 70 cm in diameter and weighing 15 to 50 kg each. Their salmon-yellow skin, embroidered when ripe, encloses thick, tender, yellow-orange flesh with an excellent sweet taste. This pumpkin is delicious in soups, gratins, soufflés and jams. Pumpkin flowers are also edible.

How to grow the Gros de Paris yellow pumpkin?

Gros de Paris Yellow squash is sown in pots 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting, from March to May, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds.

Place seedlings under a light shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 20°C, and keep the substrate moist until the seeds emerge. Be careful not to sow pumpkin seeds too early in the season, in which case the roots will become fibrous, making growth difficult in the garden. Transplant into the vegetable garden once the last frosts have passed.

From April to June, after the last risk of frost, it is possible to sow directly in the garden in 2 to 3-seed stacks.

Prepare 2 weeks in advance holes filled with compost or organic matter, spaced 2 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the squash plants or seeds. Mulch the soil to maintain sufficient humidity and limit water evaporation.

Near the pumpkins and squash, we recommend sowing corn and beans, giving rise to the ""three sisters"" or milpa crop. Also plant basil to repel pests.

When to harvest yellow pumpkin?

Although Gros de Paris yellow pumpkins can be harvested and eaten immaturely, those destined for winter storage should be picked as late as possible, before the first frosts, from July to November, when the stalk begins to dry out and the skin becomes thick. Be careful not to pull them off, but cut as close as possible to the stem, 10 cm above the stalk.

This variety of yellow squash can be stored for several months in a dry, well-ventilated place, at a temperature of between 10 and 12°C. Place the pumpkins, spaced apart and tail up, in high crates. They can also be frozen, after slicing and cooking, to keep for up to a year. In the kitchen, yellow pumpkins are delicious in winter soups, soufflés, gratins and jams.

,"Haricot Tarbais - String beans for shelling

The Tarbais bean is a very old variety with pods around 20 cm long. They offer melt-in-the-mouth beans, traditionally used in the preparation of cassoulet.

This variety can grow up to 2.50 m tall.

Characteristics of the Tarbais bean

Imported to Europe by Christopher Columbus, then cultivated in south-western France by the Bishop of Tarbes in the 17th century, beans quickly became a staple of the Pyrenees. The Tarbais bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, a product of these crops, is selected today for the preparation of cassoulet. This ancient variety of white string bean produces green pods 15 to 20 cm long, with white, thin-skinned, broad, flat beans. Once cooked, they retain all their firmness, and their melt-in-the-mouth texture makes them an ideal accompaniment to duck confit.

How to grow Tarbais beans?

Tarbais beans can be sown directly in the ground from mid-May to mid-July, or as early as March if the weather is mild. They can also be sown in pots in colder, wetter regions. Germination takes about a week. However, if seeds are soaked in lukewarm water before planting, emergence will be faster. Choose a sunny position and well-warmed, moist, well-drained soil.

Sow in rows 40 cm apart, every 8 cm, or in stacks of 3 to 5 seeds 40 cm apart in all directions, 2 to 3 cm deep. Cultivate plants 3 weeks after emergence. These pole beans can grow up to 2.50 m tall, and stakes must be installed before the voluble stems emerge for these climbing plants to develop harmoniously.

Traditionally grown in the Tarbes region, this bean is associated with corn, which provides a solid support. One bean seed is sown for every two corn seeds. Stagger sowing every 15 days to enjoy these delicious semi-dry beans for longer.

Carrots, cauliflower , beet and cucumber make excellent companion plants. Also consider tagetes and savory, which protect beans from insect pests. Avoid growing leeks and onions.

When to harvest the Tarbais Bean?

Tarbais beans are harvested in June and throughout the season, as soon as the pods start to turn yellow, so that the beans can be enjoyed semi-dry. For seed production or consumption of dried beans, wait until the pods are completely dry and brown before picking.

Although semi-dry beans can be kept for a few days in the fridge, it's best to eat them immediately after harvesting to benefit from their nutritional qualities. They can also be frozen or kept in sterilized jars after blanching. Dried beans can be stored for several years in airtight containers, but should be frozen for a few weeks to avoid bruchid infestation.

The Tarbais bean is one of the white bean varieties chosen for the cassoulet recipe with duck confit. They are equally delicious in tomato sauce, vegetable velouté or as a hummus with spices and olive oil.

,"Haricot de Soissons Gros Blanc - String beans for shelling

The Gros Blanc Soissons bean, an old variety, can climb more than 3 m high and has large, light-green pods that turn yellow when ripe. They contain 4 to 6 very large white beans. Well-suited to storage as ""dry beans"", they have a fine skin and melt-in-the-mouth texture.

Characteristics of the Gros Blanc Soissons bean

The Soissons bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is an ancient variety of shelling and string bean native to northern France's Aisne region. It is produced for the quality of its large, kidney-shaped white beans, to be eaten dry, contained in large green pods that turn yellow when ripe. With their thin skin and melt-in-the-mouth texture, these beans can be cooked in soup, purée or cassoulet, just like the Tarbais bean.

When to plant Soissons beans?

Soissons beans can be sown directly in the ground from mid-May to mid-July, or as early as March if the weather is mild. They can also be sown in pots in colder, wetter regions. Germination takes about a week. However, if seeds are soaked in lukewarm water before planting, emergence will be faster. Choose a sunny position and well-warmed, moist, well-drained soil.

Sow in rows 40 cm apart, every 8 cm, or in stacks of 3 to 5 seeds 40 cm apart in all directions, 2 to 3 cm deep. Cultivate plants 3 weeks after emergence. These pole beans can grow up to 2.50 m tall, and stakes must be installed before the voluble stems emerge for these climbing plants to develop harmoniously.

Cultivation is particularly successful in its native soil, but under warmer skies, the Soissons bean sometimes suffers from sunburn. The skin of the beans thickens and they lose their quality.

Carrots, cauliflower , beet and cucumber make excellent companion plants. Also consider tagetes and savory, which protect beans from insect pests. Avoid leeks and onions.

When to harvest Soisson beans?

Soisson beans are harvested in June and throughout the season, as soon as the pods start to turn yellow, so that the beans can be enjoyed semi-dry. For seed production or consumption of dry beans, wait until the pods are completely dry and brown before picking.

Although semi-dry beans can be kept for a few days in the fridge, it's best to eat them immediately after harvesting to benefit from their nutritional qualities. They can also be frozen or kept in sterilized jars after blanching. Dry beans can be stored for several years in an airtight container, but should be frozen for a few weeks to avoid bruchid infestation.

Its melt-in-the-mouth grains can be used in a wide range of recipes, from hot soups to cold salads, as an accompaniment to vegetables, meats and fish. They are also ideal for making cassoulets.

,"The Esperanza de Oro Spanish melon is a variety with large, sometimes irregularly shaped fruits, most of which are elongated. The thin, yellow skin encloses green to salmon-colored flesh, which is highly fragrant and sweet.

Adapted to hot, dry conditions, this variety has been selected for the size and sweetness of its fruit.

Characteristics of the Esperanza de Oro Spanish melon

The Esperanza de Oro Spanish melon, Cucumis melo, originated in the United States. This mid-season variety was selected for the size and sweetness of its fruit by a farmer in Corrales, New Mexico, and named after the family business. Drought-resistant, this Spanish melon offers large, more or less oval, yellow-skinned fruits, 10 to 20 cm in diameter, weighing up to 4 kg. Their green to orange flesh is very sweet, ideal for eating fresh in slices or in jam recipes.

How to sow the Esperanza de Oro Spanish melon?

Green Spanish melons are sown in pots of 2 to 3 seeds, 6 to 8 weeks before transplanting, from March to April. Place seedlings under a bright, warm shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 21°C. Keep substrate moist until seeds emerge. Transplant melon seedlings with the root ball in the vegetable garden, after the last frosts. From April to May, when outside temperatures no longer fall below 15°C, you can sow directly in the ground, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds. Melons need plenty of light and warmth to reach maturity before the frosts.

Prepare holes filled with compost or organic matter 2 weeks in advance, spaced 1 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the melon plants or seeds. In cooler regions, it's advisable to warm up the soil with mulch before planting, and to leave only one to three fruits per plant to encourage the ripening process. To encourage height growth and free up space on the ground, install sturdy supports when transplanting the plants.

Water freshly transplanted seedlings regularly, avoiding wetting the foliage, then reduce watering as the fruit ripens to increase sugar content and concentrate flavours.

Mulch the soil to keep it cool and limit water evaporation. In the vegetable garden, the Spanish green melon enjoys the company of corn, radishes, beans and leeks. It's best to keep it away from other Cucurbitaceae (squash, cucumber, etc.) and potatoes.

How can I tell if a Spanish melon is ripe?

The Esperanza de Oro Spanish melon is harvested from July to October, when the fruit changes color and gives off its typical fragrance. In addition, the skin around the stalk begins to crack, while that on the opposite side becomes tender. Cut the fruit as close as possible to the stem, a few centimetres above the stalk. They will keep for several days in a cool, dark place. In the kitchen, the green Spanish melon can be eaten fresh, sliced, skewered or in salads. Combined with orange or lemon, it is also very popular in jams.

Characteristics of the Rouge de Cavaillon melon

The Cavaillon melon or Rouge de Cavaillon, Cucumis melo, is an ancient variety, originally from the Midi region of France, mentioned in 1883 in the book Les Plantes Potagères by Vilmorin-Andrieux. It produces round, embroidered fruits 15 to 20 cm in diameter, with juicy, fragrant orange flesh. Its sweet taste can be enjoyed in salads, soups, jams or sliced plain.

When to sow the Cavaillon red melon?

Cavaillon melon is sown in pots, 6 to 8 weeks before transplanting, from March to April, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds. Place seedlings under a bright, warm shelter, at a temperature of between 18 and 21°C. Keep substrate moist until seeds emerge. Transplant melon seedlings with the root ball in the vegetable garden, after the last frosts. From April to May, when outside temperatures no longer fall below 15°C, you can sow directly in the ground, in bunches of 2 to 3 seeds. Melons need plenty of light and warmth to reach maturity before the frosts.

Prepare holes filled with compost or organic matter 2 weeks in advance, spaced 1 m apart in all directions, to accommodate the melon plants or seeds. In cooler regions, it's advisable to warm up the soil with mulch before planting, and to leave only one to three fruits per plant to encourage the ripening process. To encourage height growth and free up space on the ground, install sturdy supports when transplanting the plants.

Water freshly transplanted seedlings regularly, avoiding wetting the foliage, then reduce watering as the fruit ripens to increase sugar content and concentrate flavours. Mulch the soil to keep it cool and limit water evaporation. In the vegetable garden, Cavaillon melon enjoys the company of corn, radishes, beans and leeks. It's best to keep it away from other Cucurbitaceae (squash, cucumber, etc.) and potatoes.

When to harvest Cavaillon melon?

The Cavaillon melon is harvested from July to October, when the fruit changes color and gives off its typical fragrance. In addition, the skin around the stalk begins to crack, while that on the opposite side becomes tender. Cut the fruit as close as possible to the stem, a few centimetres above the stalk. They will keep for several days in a cool, dark place.

This variety can be enjoyed plain, as a velouté or in a salad. Its mild, sweet flavor goes perfectly with cured ham, mozzarella and basil. This melon can also be made into jam, flavored with vanilla and citrus.

,"Sangre is one of the prettiest of all red skinned varieties, with shallow eyes and medium-sized oblong tubers. Originally released by Colorado State University in 1982, Sangre ranks high in taste tests with creamy white flesh that is especially delicious boiled or baked.

,"This vigorous cover crop chokes out weeds, holds and protects soil structure and builds soil fertility. Balanced mix of nitrogen-fixing legumes, annual grasses, soil penetrating roots and cleansing brassicas.

Cover crops are a beneficial and often necessary part of the seasonal garden to both protect and enhance garden soil. Cover cropping solves the problem of leaving garden soil bare during the winter when wind and rain and frost heaving erode top soil and leach out nutrients. The use of cover crops creates garden soil that is fertile with the best structure to grow healthy plants.

                Seed Count: Weight: 85 g",
Fall Green Manure MixCover Crop Seed,"This ready-made mix is comprised of winter rye, field peas, ryegrass, crimson clover, and hairy vetch. Vigorous late-summer growth provides winter erosion control. The peas, clover, and ryegrass will winter kill to provide organic matter and soil cover. The hairy vetch and winter rye will regrow in the spring to provide nutrients for crops to utilize. Because the seeds of this mix vary in weight and size, it is best seeded with a grain drill. Sow at 50 lb./acre or 1 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. Inoculate with Garden Combination Inoculant (#7531) or Pea, Vetch, and Lentil Inoculant (#7534) for best performance.",
Sweet AlyssumFlower Seed,"Sweet Alyssum is fast and low growing, trouble free, and low cost, making it a popular choice for use as beneficial insect habitat in vegetable and fruit production. Because of its very manageable plant habit, Sweet Alyssum is a good choice for beneficial planting in greenhouses and containers, in addition to outdoor production. Sprawling plants with dense clusters of small flowers. Commonly known as sweet alyssum, but also known simply as alyssum. Tender perennial in Zones 9-11.",
Hairy VetchOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sow spring to late summer with or without grain, grass, or field peas. When sown in late summer, spring regrowth is vigorous and nitrogen producing for tilling in before planting the spring garden crops. Typical nitrogen produced is 110 lbs./acre. This rapid spring growth also makes it a good weed suppressant. Hairy vetch prefers well-drained soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0, and will do poorly in clay or wet fields. It will do well in soils too acidic for many clovers and alfalfas. May have some allelopathic properties, so it is best to allow 2-3 weeks between incorporating and seeding of small-seeded crops. This selected hardy strain is widely adapted and withstands all but severe winters if sown in late summer or fall. Sow at 1 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (40 lb./acre) with rye or oats. Inoculate with Garden Combination Inoculant (#7531) or Pea, Vetch, and Lentil Inoculant (#7534) for best performance. Blue label/Certified seed. USDA Certified Organic.",
PhaceliaFlower Seed,"Most commonly seeded in mass plantings, or as an annual cover crop with nectar-rich blooms to attract and support beneficial and pollinator insects. An excellent, fast-growing, easy-to-grow source of nectar for honeybee forage. Tolerant of low water conditions and poor soils. Used as a cover crop, will winterkill at 18°F (-8°C) — residue breaks down relatively quickly. Furled, lavender-colored flowers with tall, sturdy stems are sometimes used as a cut flower, adding a casual, wildflower look to bouquets. Also commonly known as bee's friend, lacy phacelia, blue tansy, purple tansy, and lacy scorpion-weed. Relative of borage and native to the United States and Mexico. For mass plantings or cover crop, sow at 3 oz./1,000 sq.ft. or 7 lb./acre.",
BuckwheatCover Crop Seed,"Sow in late May through July and till in about a month later, when flowering has begun. For grain harvest, sow 3 months before fall frost. Harvest after killing frost. Also available in organic seed.",
Buckwheat (Common)Organic Cover Crop Seed,"Buckwheat is widely grown as a grain crop, bee pasture, soil improving cover crop and as wildlife cover. It is a warm season grain which grows rapidly during the summer and several crops per year may be had with proper management. This rapid and dense growth chokes out weeds and is used in crop-free fields in rotation with vegetables. Buckwheat is often grown to attract beneficial insects and as pasture for honey bees. Sow in late May through July and till in about a month later, when flowering has begun. For grain harvest, sow 3 months before fall frost. Harvest after killing frost. Planting rate: 2-3 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (60 lb./acre), one-fifth less when planting for grain harvest. Blue label/Certified seed. USDA Certified Organic.",
New Zealand White CloverCover Crop Seed,"Once established, white clover can handle foot and tractor traffic better than other clovers. The fibrous root system typically is in the top 8"" of soil, although it does have up to a 40"" tap root in the first year which dies each fall, leaving a passage for water to percolate through. More heat tolerant than some of the larger clovers, this is a low-growing (to 12"") perennial that can be sown into long-season row crops during the season to provide a ""living mulch."" Sow after first cultivation at 1/4 lb. per 1,000 sq.ft. (10 lb./acre) and rake or cultivate to cover. Also used for green manure, hay, and pasture. Inoculate with Alfalfa/True Clover Inoculant (#7535) for best performance.",
Crimson CloverCover Crop Seed,"Grows to 1–3' and sports striking crimson blossoms in abundance. Where winter lows fall above -10°F (-23.3°C), it is sown in late summer, lies dormant in winter, resumes growth in spring, and flowers in May. Crimson clover fixes up to 200 pounds of nitrogen per acre, and prefers well-drained, loam soils with good organic matter content for best results. It is an excellent choice for underseeding as it grows well in the shade of other crops. Easier to incorporate in the spring than Hairy Vetch. Do not use for frost seeding as it won't handle the cold nearly as well as red clover. Crimson clover will not re-grow after close grazing or mowing once flowering has begun. Crimson clover does best in cool, humid weather and will perform poorly in the heat of summer. Sow 20-25 lb./acre alone or with grain/grass. May be pre-inoculated with OMRI Listed® EXCEED and coated with OMRI Listed® Nitro-Coat® Organic.",
Yellow MustardCover Crop Seed,"Mustard residues which contain glucosinolates are known to suppress soil-borne fungi and nematodes. For use as a soil biofumigant, mow mustard crop at flowering stage, but before mature seed set, and incorporate into the soil immediately. Performs best as a fall planted crop. Thrives in cool conditions. Sow at 15-20 lb./acre.",
Crimson CloverOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Grows to 1-3' and sports striking crimson blossoms in abundance. Where winter lows fall above -10°F (-23.3°C), it is sown in late summer, lies dormant in winter, resumes growth in spring, and flowers in May.

Inoculate with Inoculate with Alfalfa/True Clover Inoculant (#7535) for best performance. USDA Certified Organic.",
Medium Red CloverOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Fast to establish, tolerates most soil types, and is suitable for hay or silage. Often used as a cover crop between rows of vegetable crops if mowed to maintain manageability. Can fix up to 150 lb. of nitrogen per acre. Sow 5–15 lb. per acre. USDA Certified Organic.",
Mammoth Red CloverOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"A tall (2–3'), quick-growing clover. Sow in spring, summer or fall, alone or with grain/grass at 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (15–20 lb./acre). Will grow in more acid soil (pH 5.0-6.0) than other clovers if lime is applied at seeding time. Widely grown biennial used for Nitrogen addition and hay crops. Large plant with big leaves makes it an ideal grazing crop. Red clover may be the best choice for frost seeding; it is extremely cold hardy and does well in most soils and growing conditions. it does, like most clovers, perform poorly in hot weather unless seeded into a crop canopy. Incorporate fully for best results. Mammoth Red clover will fix between 70-110 lbs. nitrogen per acre. The long taproots loosen soils and mine phosphorus and other nutrients from deep in the soil. It should be seeded with 48-64 lbs. or 1.5-2 bushels/acre of oats to ""nurse"" the clover. Inoculate with Alfalfa/True Clover Inoculant (#7535) for best performance.",
Fall Green Manure MixCover Crop Seed,"This ready-made mix is comprised of winter rye, field peas, ryegrass, crimson clover, and hairy vetch. Vigorous late-summer growth provides winter erosion control. The peas, clover, and ryegrass will winter kill to provide organic matter and soil cover.

Sow at 50 lb./acre or 1 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. Inoculate with Garden Combination Inoculant (#7531) or Pea, Vetch, and Lentil Inoculant (#7534) for best performance.",
Peas and Oats MixOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Mixed to meet our farm manager's preferred percentages of 70% peas and 30% oats. Sow in early spring for a spring/summer cover crop. For a winter cover, sow in late summer or early fall. Sow at 5 lb./1,000 sq.ft., or about 120-200 lb./acre. Peas provide nitrogen and organic matter; oats act as a nurse crop and trellis for the peas. Both will winterkill in northern areas if oats are not allowed to re-seed. Specialized equipment, which is often needed for terminating (mowing and incorporating) perennial cover crops, is not necessary. An easy choice for home gardeners. Inoculate with Garden Combination Inoculant (#7531) or Pea, Vetch, and Lentil Inoculant (#7534) for best performance.",
Oats (Common)Organic Cover Crop Seed,"Early maturing and good standing with very high yields. A good choice for underseeding with a legume. Oats are a quick-growing green manure. For winter cover, sow by early Sept. in the North, slightly later farther south; the heavy stubble will prevent erosion and oats will not regrow in the spring like winter rye. For grain production, sow seeds in early spring for a late-summer harvest. Sow at 3-4 lb./1,000 sq.ft., or about 150 lb./acre. USDA Certified Organic.",
Winter Rye (Common)Organic Cover Crop Seed,"If rye grain or straw is desired, sow in fall for midsummer harvest. For green manure, sow anytime spring through midfall at 4-6 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (60-120 lb./acre). USDA Certified Organic.",

Inoculate with Garden Combination Inoculant (#7531) or Pea, Vetch, and Lentil Inoculant (#7534) for best performance. Blue label/Certified seed. USDA Certified Organic.",
Field Peas (Maxum)Cover Crop Seed,"Pea tendrils (the most recent 6–8"" of growth) are also great in salad mixes, and the dry yellow peas can be cooked in soup. In spring or fall, sow alone at 3 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (120 lb./acre). Can also be mixed with vetch and/or oats, winter rye, or ryegrass. Peas smother weeds better than spring-sown clover. Inoculate with Garden Combination Inoculant (#7531) or Pea, Vetch, and Lentil Inoculant (#7534) for best performance.",

Sweet CloverOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sweet clover can grow nearly anywhere, with as little as 16 inches of rainfall per year. It has deep tap roots that mine soil nutrients and water from deep within the soil. It is better than many of the other clovers for nutrient recycling and appears to have a greater capacity to extract potassium, phosphorus and other soil nutrients from insoluble minerals. Sow in spring to summer at 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (15 lb./acre) as an annual, or let grow the next year over 6 ft. tall. Should be grown with 1½ to 2 bushels of oats as a ""nurse"" crop. Sweet clover is slow to establish the first year and may have some winter kill without adequate snow cover. Second year growth is tremendous. Will fix as much nitrogen as alfalfa and doesn't require an acid soil. Can produce as much as 170 lb. of nitrogen per acre although 100 lb. per acre is closer to the average. Excellent conditioner for poor and thin soils. Mostly yellow with some white flowers. Pre-inoculated with OMRI listed Nitragin Gold. USDA Certified Organic.",

VNS Yellow PeaOrganic Field Pea Seed,"Yellow peas are a great non-GMO protein source and are becoming more prevalent in feed rations with protein percentages ranging from 21–25. They contain high levels of carbohydrates, are low in fiber, and contain 86–87% total digestible nutrients, making them an excellent livestock feed. In spring or fall, sow 5 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (200 lb./acre) alone, or 3 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (120 lb./acre) mixed with vetch and/or oats, winter rye, or ryegrass. Harvest for grain at 16–18% moisture or when the seeds are hardened and fully mature. USDA Certified Organic.",
Summer AlfalfaCover Crop Seed,"Long taproots break up compacted soil and bring up subsurface minerals. High nitrogen fixation and great bee forage. Sow early to midspring or in late summer (best time for weed competition), 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (15-20 lb./acre) alone. Use half this rate when mixed with grain/grass. Inoculate with Alfalfa/True Clover Inoculant (#7535) for best performance.",
RyegrassCover Crop Seed,"Ryegrass is a great nitrogen scavenger and can assimilate as much as 200 lb./acre/year of nitrogen. Most of that nitrogen then becomes available to subsequent crops, thus saving on fertilizer input. Annual ryegrass is a very competitive winter annual, with good seedling vigor, fast germination (with adequate moisture) and rapid establishment. Annual ryegrass is a bunch grass, yellowish-green at the base, with long glossy green leaves up to 12"" each. It will overwinter in certain years. When used as a cover crop, annual ryegrass is killed in the spring before it reaches seed formation stage. Sow from early spring through late summer. As winter cover, ryegrass will winter kill, but still help protect the soil. Sow, then rake to lightly cover. Seeding rate: short-term lawn (thick) 4 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (160-170 lb./acre); cover crop (thinner) 1 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (40 lb./acre).",

Inoculate with Garden Combination Inoculant (#7531) or Pea, Vetch, and Lentil Inoculant (#7534) for best performance. Pea tendrils add a flair of color to your salad mixes, and dried yellow peas can be used in soups. White flowers. USDA Certified Organic.",
Hulless Oats (Streaker)Organic Cover Crop Seed,"When harvested and threshed, the oat kernels are almost free of the tough, inedible hulls of common oats.
