	Description

Monarch larvae feed exclusively on Milkweed plants. including Butterfly Milkweed (Asclepias Tuberosa) that has been recommended by the North American Butterfly Association. Monarchs are probably the most well known butterflies in North America. Sadly, the number of Monarchs seen in our gardens has been decreasing over the last decade. One of the factors that is causing this decrease is the loss of the Monarch caterpillars’ food plant, namely, milkweeds. This species of milkweed does not spread by runners like common milkweed therefore it is not invasive. Native to North America. Fun for kids and adults alike!

A favorite of the humminbird moth and sphinx moths.

Indescribably fragrant, Moonflower is one of the joys of the night garden, and this 6-foot vine is particularly effective on the patio, twining up the porch railings, or set under windows, where the fragrance can be appreciated indoors and out.
An easy, carefree vine, Moonflower can be started ahead indoors or direct-sown when the soil is warm in any sunny garden spot. The blooms arise all summer and into fall. Magnificent!
Soak these seed in warm water for 24 hours before planting.

"Clover,  Crimson","
				
	Description

Pasture and hay crop. Crimson clover is excellent for grazing and haying. It will regrow if grazed or mowed no lower than 3 or 4 inches before the early bud stage. Mixing with grass reduces its relatively low bloat risk even further. Timely mowing four to six weeks before bloom improves growth, reduces lodging and will cause more uniform flowering and seed ripening on highly fertile.
With its rapid, robust growth, crimson clover provides early spring nitrogen for full-season crops. Rapid fall growth, or summer growth in cool areas, also makes it a top choice for short-rotation niches as a weed suppressing green manure. Popular as a staple forage, crimson clover is gaining increased recognition as a versatile summer-annual cover in colder regions. Its spectacular beauty when flowering keeps it visible even in a mix with other flowering legumes.
Since those early days of food plot experimentation, crimson clover has become one of the most popular annual clovers planted for deer. It is highly preferred by deer as it is an easily digestible, nutritious cool season food plot crop that can withstand heavy, continuous grazing.
Can be mixed with rye and other cereals, vetches, annual ryegrass, red clover.
This seed is an annual although it may reseed itself in fall in warmer climates.
