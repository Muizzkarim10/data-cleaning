A favorite of the humminbird moth and sphinx moths.

Indescribably fragrant, Moonflower is one of the joys of the night garden, and this 6-foot vine is particularly effective on the patio, twining up the porch railings, or set under windows, where the fragrance can be appreciated indoors and out.
An easy, carefree vine, Moonflower can be started ahead indoors or direct-sown when the soil is warm in any sunny garden spot. The blooms arise all summer and into fall. Magnificent!

56,"Clover,  Crimson","
				
	Description

Pasture and hay crop. Crimson clover is excellent for grazing and haying. It will regrow if grazed or mowed no lower than 3 or 4 inches before the early bud stage. Mixing with grass reduces its relatively low bloat risk even further. Timely mowing four to six weeks before bloom improves growth, reduces lodging and will cause more uniform flowering and seed ripening on highly fertile.
With its rapid, robust growth, crimson clover provides early spring nitrogen for full-season crops. Rapid fall growth, or summer growth in cool areas, also makes it a top choice for short-rotation niches as a weed suppressing green manure. Popular as a staple forage, crimson clover is gaining increased recognition as a versatile summer-annual cover in colder regions. Its spectacular beauty when flowering keeps it visible even in a mix with other flowering legumes.
Since those early days of food plot experimentation, crimson clover has become one of the most popular annual clovers planted for deer. It is highly preferred by deer as it is an easily digestible, nutritious cool season food plot crop that can withstand heavy, continuous grazing.
Can be mixed with rye and other cereals, vetches, annual ryegrass, red clover.
This seed is an annual although it may reseed itself in fall in warmer climates.

155,Fall Green Manure MixCover Crop Seed,"This ready-made mix is comprised of winter rye, field peas, ryegrass, crimson clover, and hairy vetch. Vigorous late-summer growth provides winter erosion control. The peas, clover, and ryegrass will winter kill to provide organic matter and soil cover. The hairy vetch and winter rye will regrow in the spring to provide nutrients for crops to utilize. Because the seeds of this mix vary in weight and size, it is best seeded with a grain drill. Sow at 50 lb./acre or 1 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft.

157,Hairy VetchOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sow spring to late summer with or without grain, grass, or field peas. When sown in late summer, spring regrowth is vigorous and nitrogen producing for tilling in before planting the spring garden crops. Typical nitrogen produced is 110 lbs./acre. This rapid spring growth also makes it a good weed suppressant. Hairy vetch prefers well-drained soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0, and will do poorly in clay or wet fields. It will do well in soils too acidic for many clovers and alfalfas. May have some allelopathic properties, so it is best to allow 2-3 weeks between incorporating and seeding of small-seeded crops. This selected hardy strain is widely adapted and withstands all but severe winters if sown in late summer or fall. Sow at 1 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (40 lb./acre) with rye or oats.

An excellent, fast-growing, easy-to-grow source of nectar for honeybee forage. Tolerant of low water conditions and poor soils. Used as a cover crop, will winterkill at 18°F (-8°C) — residue breaks down relatively quickly. Furled, lavender-colored flowers with tall, sturdy stems are sometimes used as a cut flower, adding a casual, wildflower look to bouquets. Also commonly known as bee's friend, lacy phacelia, blue tansy, purple tansy, and lacy scorpion-weed. Relative of borage and native to the United States and Mexico.

Will grow in more acid soil (pH 5.0-6.0) than other clovers if lime is applied at seeding time. Widely grown biennial used for Nitrogen addition and hay crops. Large plant with big leaves makes it an ideal grazing crop. Red clover may be the best choice for frost seeding; it is extremely cold hardy and does well in most soils and growing conditions. it does, like most clovers, perform poorly in hot weather unless seeded into a crop canopy. Incorporate fully for best results. Mammoth Red clover will fix between 70-110 lbs. nitrogen per acre. The long taproots loosen soils and mine phosphorus and other nutrients from deep in the soil.

213,New Zealand White CloverCover Crop Seed,"Once established, white clover can handle foot and tractor traffic better than other clovers. The fibrous root system typically is in the top 8"" of soil, although it does have up to a 40"" tap root in the first year which dies each fall, leaving a passage for water to percolate through. More heat tolerant than some of the larger clovers, this is a low-growing (to 12"") perennial that can be sown into long-season row crops during the season to provide a ""living mulch."" Sow after first cultivation at 1/4 lb. per 1,000 sq.ft. (10 lb./acre) and rake or cultivate to cover. Also used for green manure, hay, and pasture.

Will grow in more acid soil (pH 5.0-6.0) than other clovers if lime is applied at seeding time. Widely grown biennial used for Nitrogen addition and hay crops. Large plant with big leaves makes it an ideal grazing crop. Red clover may be the best choice for frost seeding; it is extremely cold hardy and does well in most soils and growing conditions. it does, like most clovers, perform poorly in hot weather unless seeded into a crop canopy. Incorporate fully for best results. Mammoth Red clover will fix between 70-110 lbs. nitrogen per acre. The long taproots loosen soils and mine phosphorus and other nutrients from deep in the soil.

218,Sweet CloverOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sweet clover can grow nearly anywhere, with as little as 16 inches of rainfall per year. It has deep tap roots that mine soil nutrients and water from deep within the soil. It is better than many of the other clovers for nutrient recycling and appears to have a greater capacity to extract potassium, phosphorus and other soil nutrients from insoluble minerals. Sow in spring to summer at 1/2 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (15 lb./acre) as an annual, or let grow the next year over 6 ft. tall. Should be grown with 1½ to 2 bushels of oats as a ""nurse"" crop. Sweet clover is slow to establish the first year and may have some winter kill without adequate snow cover. Second year growth is tremendous. Will fix as much nitrogen as alfalfa and doesn't require an acid soil. Can produce as much as 170 lb. of nitrogen per acre although 100 lb. per acre is closer to the average. Excellent conditioner for poor and thin soils. Mostly yellow with some white flowers. Pre-inoculated with OMRI listed Nitragin Gold.

226,Hairy VetchOrganic Cover Crop Seed,"Sow spring to late summer with or without grain, grass, or field peas. When sown in late summer, spring regrowth is vigorous and nitrogen producing for tilling in before planting the spring garden crops. Typical nitrogen produced is 110 lbs./acre. This rapid spring growth also makes it a good weed suppressant. Hairy vetch prefers well-drained soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0, and will do poorly in clay or wet fields. It will do well in soils too acidic for many clovers and alfalfas. May have some allelopathic properties, so it is best to allow 2-3 weeks between incorporating and seeding of small-seeded crops. This selected hardy strain is widely adapted and withstands all but severe winters if sown in late summer or fall. Sow at 1 lb./1,000 sq.ft. (40 lb./acre) with rye or oats.
