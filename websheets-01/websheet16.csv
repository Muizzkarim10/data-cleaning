Buckwheat Cover Crop Seed,"Buckwheat's greatest quality is its ability to out-compete weeds. This quick-growing tender annual also builds organic matter.
For a fall crop, sow in late August/early September. Just make sure your crop does not set seed, as buckwheat can be weedy if allowed to self sow. As long as no seeds form, simply let the buckwheat winter kill, and incorporate in the spring if necessary.
Several successions of buckwheat can be grown during the season. For a summer cover crop, mow or cultivate at flowering to kill the plants.

Sown in late fall, spinach sprouts and grows a bit before resting during deepest winter, then emerges powerfully in the cool of early spring, like a chicken squawking at the first hint of dawn. Spinach is just as happy sown in early spring or late summer, but there is no competing with the delicacy and sweetness of an overwintered crop.",https://hudsonvalleyseed.com/cdn/shop/products/Bulls-Blood-Beet-vendor-unknown-1630677657.jpg?v=1630677660
Buttercrunch Bibb Lettuce,"David Landreth was born at Haggerston, Northumberland, England in 1752. He established one of the first American commercial seed companies.

Calendula,"One of the most popular edible flowers, borage's star-shaped blossoms have a pleasant cucumber-like flavor.

China Rose Winter Radish,"A striking heirloom beet, deep red from the roots to the leaves. The deep red color of the leaves is marvelous as a baby leaf. The color deeps further still as the beets mature. The roots, though modest, are quite nice and uniform. Great as a bunched beet and for greens, but not recommended as a storage beet.

Chioggia Guardsmark Improved Beets,"Bibb lettuce possesses a tantalizing texture: at once smooth and crisp. The round leaves wrap loosely together. A beautiful and fun-to-eat salad can be made by harvesting the whole head and setting the plant in a salad bowl (remove the core first). Toss some shredded veggies and roasted nuts on top, drizzle with dressing, and voila!

Costata Romanesca Zucchini,"Collards are extraordinarily nutritious and make delicious greasy greens, braised in oil with garlic. It's easy to pluck a big bunch and cook them quickly.

Crosby Egyptian Beet,"These long, cylindrical radishes sort of resemble carrots, but that's where the similarities end. Best when planted under slightly cooler conditions (think late-summer), the China Rose Winter radish is great for long-term cold-weather storage. Vibrant, red skin gives way to white, firm flesh.

Dark Star Zucchini,"For years, cilantro was known as ""Chinese Parsley."" As Mexican and Indian food became more popular, Americans discovered that cilantro's refreshing flavor was loved by cultures worldwide. Its tender, sweet taste elevates the flavor of nearly any dish, though some people are genetically cursed to find cilantro's flavor soapy and intolerable.

Deitrich's Wild Broccoli Raab,"Cilantro is wonderful to have on hand: chop some up and toss in vegetable soups, or in curries, or on stir fries. It is best used just before serving, sprinkled on the dish at the table. Note that cilantro must be sown in succession in order to have an extended harvest.

Detroit Dark Red Beet,"Seeds are biologically designed for travel. During the period of European colonization, they traveled farther and faster than they ever had before, as mariners brought seeds of American crops back to their homelands. Hundreds of years of selection later, seeds of many of these crops in new and varied forms re-crossed the Atlantic with immigrants. For eating, pick this variety at the dinghy stage rather than waiting for it to turn into a yacht. Saving seeds? Let it grow as big as a battleship.

Easter Egg Radish,"The magic of carrots is in the unknown. Somewhere within the darkness of the soil, teeming with invisible life, nutrients seek a vessel to be passed from earth to plant to bodies. Carrots make gardeners feel like magicians: the orange flash, when pulled from the earth, draws gasps and applause, if only in our minds. But the true magic is revealed in the eating, when the vivid color gives way to a sweet crunch that somehow makes us feel as bright and strong and well-anchored as the freshly picked root.

Farmers Bill Reynolds and Donna Ferguson were on the search for open-habit, drought tolerance, and good flavor in their zucchinis.

It was also Kale's favorite brassica, as it is for gardeners worldwide, who have given it many names: Lacinato, Cavolo Nero, Tuscan Kale, Palm Tree Kale, and Dinosaur Kale.

Not actually a young bunching onion but a member of a separate, non-bulbing species, Evergreen Scallion is versatile, easy-to-grow, and delicious.

Organic Microgreens: Amaranth,"Trying to trace the origins of the modern orange carrot is like looking through a kaleidoscope. Shapes and colors reflect and refract, and the more time you spend looking, the more they change. The carrot's geo-genetic story starts with a white and wild bitter root, touched by the sweet yellow sun of the Middle East, growing under purple mountains and bright vermillion sunsets, its seeds passed by thousands of hands of many hues.

Parisian Carrot,"In the Pali language of ancient Buddhism, ""Metta"" is the word for loving-kindness, the attribute of benevolence and good will felt toward others.

Piracicaba Broccoli,"A staple of Japanese and Korean cuisine, daikon radishes are unbelievably fast-growing even in the cool, shortening days of fall and are an excellent, underappreciated root for the winter kitchen. They excel in cooked preparations, especially stir-fries and roasts, where their flesh is tender, buttery, and mild. Erin made a great ginger-and-daikon kimchi that we're all still dreaming of: we ate it like candy, straight out of the jar. They store beautifully in a root cellar or right in the fridge, and they can be harvested after the first mild frosts without much damage to the root (they will not make it through hard freezes without a decrease in quality, unfortunately).

Prizehead Lettuce,"If a mix of beautiful baby leaves is your ideal salad, then Mizuna Red Streaks Mustard is a must have for your garden!

Provider Bush Green Bean,"Looking closely, slowly, and quietly in this hyper-connected age, the skill of meditative observation is a lost art.

Really Red Deer Tongue Lettuce,"AKA Saltwort. This cool season annual is native to Japan’s salt marshes, but will thrive in a variety of soils. Traditionally used in side dishes and salads, it is mainly eaten fresh or lightly steamed. It can also be dried and rehydrated later. A member of the Amaranthaceae family, the appearance is grass-like, but the greens have a tasty, tart, and salty flavor with an underlying nuttiness.

Royal Oakleaf Lettuce,"Parris Island is in coastal South Carolina, in a climate that is not all that favorable for lettuce cultivation.
