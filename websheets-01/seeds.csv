Angelica (Wild Celery / Holy Ghost),"Angelica (Angelica archangelica), also called Wild Celery and Holy Ghost, is a fragrant herb in the carrot family. Like a carrot, it’s a biennial that flowers the second year, and it has a long thick root. But it’s not a carrot. For starters, it tastes like licorice. And the plant can grow to 4'-6' tall.

"Basil, Lettuce Leaf","
Let us tell you about Lettuce Leaf Basil. It’s a lovely Italian basil that grows huge leaves as big as your hand, with a flavor that’s sweeter and less spicy than other basils. Its crinkles hold onto dressing in salads, you need only one leaf for a sandwich or wrap, and you can use the rest as you would any other basil. Save the edible flower spikes to garnish seafood dishes and cocktails.

Harvest the leaves and stems from the top part of the plant, and pinch off edible flower buds as they appear, which prevents the leaves from turning bitter, and signals the plant to branch out and grow more leaves, making a bushier plant. The more you harvest, the more it grows!

Black Salsify (Black Oyster Plant/Scorzonera),"Black Salsify, also called Scorzonera and Black Oyster Plant, is a cold hardy perennial in the aster and lettuce family grown for its thin root with rough black skin over white flesh that can grow 1'-3' long if it has the room. Take care when harvesting, as the roots are delicate and snap easily.  Any root left behind will re-grow!

It would be fun for a blind taste test, as the edible yellow dandelion-like flower petals smell like cocoa, the edible flower buds taste like okra, and the roots taste like oyster, asparagus, or artichoke, turning sweeter and earthier after a frost.

The stems and long, wide leaves that can grow 3'-4' tall are also edible. Delicious roasted, mashed, grilled, and pickled, or simply sautéed in a little butter for a rich, unusual side dish.

Sweet, earthy flavor

Caraway,"


Caraway is an ancient aromatic herb, famous for being the spice in rye bread and German sauerkraut. A biennial in the carrot family that grows 1'-3' tall, with feathery foliage and tiny white flowers. The seeds, which have an earthy-citrusy-peppery flavor, are the most used, but the flowers, leaves, stems, and root (which looks like a small parsnip, and can be used like any other root vegetable) are also edible. While you’re waiting for the flowers, seeds, and roots to develop in the second year, spend the first year using the leaves, which have a parsley-dill flavor, in salads, soups, and sautés.

Parsley-dill flavor
All parts are edible
Culinary and medicinal uses
Good for containers


As a companion plant, it attracts pollinators and beneficial insects, and repels aphids, cabbage moths, cabbage white butterfly, cabbage worms, carrot root fly, and caterpillars.

As a medicinal herb, Caraway has been used internally to treat asthma, bad breath, bloating, colds, colic, cough, flatulence, heartburn, indigestion, insomnia, lack of appetite, nausea, sore throat, and stomach cramps, and externally to treat arthritis, bruises, burns, skin irritation, toothache, and wounds.

What is Caraway?


Caraway is a biennial. This means it takes two years for the plant to mature, produce seeds, then die. During the winter you may not see any evidence of the plant even though the roots are preparing for spring. So mark your spot carefully so you don’t accidentally dig them up in the spring.

An interesting legend that goes along with Caraway is that it had the power to prevent the theft of objects that had seeds nearby and it also kept lovers from losing interest in one another.  Still, some believe Caraway has beneficial healing powers and you can use the oil, fruit and seeds as medicine.







Health Benefits of Caraway

Women can use Caraway oil to relieve menstral cramps. Feeling bloated or have a bit of indigestion? Chewing on a few Caraway seeds can help relieve your symptoms!



 





Ways to Consume Caraway


If you want to consume the leaves, pick them when they are young and tender. The roots are also edible when the plant is young.  Use Caraway seeds in baked goods, such as breads, and buns.  Add them to vegetable and fruit dishes, especially curries.  Use leaves and seeds alike to make hot and cold teas.

Caraway seeds have a sharp, pungent, slightly licorice taste that’s is delicious with green beans, potatoes, cabbage, onions, brussels sprouts, tomatoes, and apples. Try mixing it with cucumber and sour cream. It’s delicious with sausage and beef.

Catnip,"Catnip is not the most beautiful plant you can grow, but it’s quite useful. The small spikes of white speckled flowers attract pollinators and beneficial insects to the vegetable garden. And the same compound that sends cats flying to the moon also sends mosquitoes flying away. Also repels ants, aphids, cabbage moths, cabbage white butterfly, cabbage worms, potato beetles, cucumber beetles, flea beetles, Japanese beetles, mice, roaches, slugs, squash bugs, voles, and weevils, which makes it a great companion for just about everyone (except Parsley). Reseeds easily and can become invasive. Use the minty leaves to flavor tea, pasta, vegetables, soups, and sauces.

As a medicinal herb, Catnip has been used internally to treat anxiety, colds, cough, fever, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, sore throat, and upset stomach, and externally to treat black eyes and other bruises.

"Chamomile, German","


German Chamomile has been cultivated as a medicinal herb for thousands of years and was used by ancient Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, and Vikings. An easy care annual in the daisy family, it has small white flowers with large yellow hollow cone centers that proliferate on a bushy shrub of feathery foliage. Only the sweet apple-scented flowers are used fresh or dried, usually steeped into a soothing herbal tea that can be used as a facial tonic or sipped by kids and adults right before it’s time to go night-night.

As a companion plant, it attracts pollinators and beneficial insects; repels cabbage moths, cabbage white fly, cabbage worms, cucumber beetles, and mosquitoes; and is said to increase the fragrance and flavor of aromatic herbs such as basil, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage, and thyme.

Roman Chamomile has many of the same uses, but is a low-growing, evergreen perennial groundcover with fewer, but larger flowers. You can determine which type of Chamomile you have if you cut open the yellow center of the flower. Roman has solid centers while German has hollow ones.

As a medicinal herb, Chamomile has been used internally to treat allergies, anxiety, arthritis, asthma, colds, colic, cough, flatulence, gum disease, headache, indigestion, inflammation, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), menstrual cramps, morning sickness, stress, nervousness, restlessness, and stomach upset, and externally to treat burns, earache, hemorrhoids, mouth sores, skin problems, sunburns, teething pain, tired eyes, toothache, and wounds.

⚠️ Do not handle or ingest if you are allergic to ragweed.

⚠️ Medicinal properties are presented as information only, and are not a recommendation or prescription for use. Consult a medical professional before using any herb medicinally.

"Chamomile, Roman","


Roman Chamomile, also called English Chamomile, has been cultivated as a medicinal herb since Medieval times. This hardy, aromatic, mat-forming groundcover perennial in the daisy family produces small white flowers with large yellow solid cone centers and aromatic, fern-like foliage. Easily spreads through both reseeding and creeping roots, and can become invasive. Use it to fill in space between stones or pavers, or create a fragrant, low-maintenance “chamomile lawn” like the royals do at Buckingham Palace. Both the apple-scented flowers and stems are used fresh or dried, and steeped into a calming herbal tea sipped before beddy-bye time.

Chervil (French Parsley),"Chervil, also called French Parsley and Garden Chervil, is an ancient aromatic annual in the parsley family, with similar fern-like leaves, tiny white flowers, and a sweet flavor that’s a delicate mix of parsley, anise, and pepper. Leaves, stems, seeds, and flowers are all edible. It prefers growing in part shade in moist soil with cool temps, so it’s good for indoor gardens or fall/winter gardens in mild climates. An important ingredient in fines herbes, along with chives, parsley, and tarragon, used extensively in French gourmet cooking. Loses its flavor when dried, so chop or chiffonade to add a freshness to salads, dressings, herb butter, sauces, seafood, peas, poultry, green beans, carrots, eggs, and herbal tea.

As a companion plant, it attracts pollinators and beneficial insects, and repels ants, aphids, slugs, and snails.

As a medicinal herb, Chervil has been used internally to treat arthritis, bronchitis, congestion, cough, gum disease, hiccups, low blood pressure, menstrual cramps, skin problems, and swelling, and externally to treat painful joints, tired eyes, and wounds.

"Flowers - Milkweed, Tropical (Monarch Butterfly/Blood Flower) - Silky Deep Red","Silky Deep Red Tropical Milkweed (Asclepias curassavica), also called Blood Flower, is striking in the garden and is a vital host plant for the endangered monarch butterfly. This easy care bushy perennial reseeds easily, isn’t fussy about soil or water, and can grow just about anywhere. Puts out bright, showy 2""-4"" flower clusters in brilliant red-orange with yellow centers on slender stems that grow 2'-3' tall. Blooms continuously summer through fall, providing migrating monarchs with nectar snacks for their long journey and a place to lay their eggs. Can be grown as an annual in cooler grow zones. Lovely and long-lasting in cut flower arrangements.


Life cycle: Herbaceous perennial
Bloom season: Summer, fall
Attracts: Beneficial insects, hummingbirds, bees, butterflies, and other pollinators
Flower meaning: Dignity, freedom, rejection, remembrance, solitude

As a medicinal plant, Milkweed has been used internally to treat diarrhea, gonorrhea, intestinal parasites and worms, pneumonia, spleen inflammation, and stomach tumors, and externally to treat bleeding, boils, corns, dermatitis, eye infections, ringworm, skin parasites, snakebites, sores, warts, and wounds.

⚠️ Although Milkweed is known to be safe when used correctly, all parts of the plant are toxic and may even cause death to people, pets, horses, and livestock if ingested in large quantities. The milky sap is a skin irritant. Do not ingest while pregnant or nursing.

⚠️ Medicinal properties are presented as information only, and are not a recommendation or prescription for use. Consult a medical professional before using any plant medicinally.

NOTE: A parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE), travels with monarchs and is deposited on every plant they visit. In warm grow zones where this non-native milkweed does not die back from a killing frost, the OE parasite can build up and harm the caterpillars that feed on the leaves and the butterflies they become. A continuously blooming milkweed may also encourage the monarchs to dally rather than migrate, which interrupts their reproductive cycle. It’s easy to eliminate both dangers, by cutting your plants to the ground at least once per season.

More facts about Milkweed:

The beautiful monarch butterflies rely on milkweed to lay their eggs upon. Sadly, habitats that naturally support monarchs are becoming fewer in number each year. New urban development & chemically treated ""big agriculture"" are destroying habitats of milkweed all over the United States.

Flowers - Soapwort,"



Soapwort (Saponaria officinalis) is a beautiful, robust perennial in the carnation family with dark green lance-shaped leaves and light pink star-shaped flowers that have a pleasant floral clove scent. Can grow 1'-2' tall and 12""-18"" wide, and prefers cooler weather. The entire plant contains saponins, with the highest concentration in the roots, which make a gentle foamy lather when mixed with warm water, and is used as detergent or soap to clean skin, hair, and delicate fabrics. Also called Bouncing Bet, a historical expression for a laundry woman. Reseeding and runner roots enable it to spread easily and it can become invasive.

As a medicinal plant, Soapwort has been used internally to treat bronchitis, colds, cough, diarrhea, kidney stones, and respiratory problems, and externally to treat acne, boils, burns, eczema, inflammation, itchy skin, muscle pain, poison ivy, psoriasis, rash, and wounds.

""Currently an undervalued herb, it is often used as a household remedy, particularly as an expectorant and stomach tonic. It has a positive effect when used to treat bronchitis and respiratory infections, especially where there is excessive mucous production. Hyssop can irritate the mucous membranes, so it is best given after an infection has peaked, when the herb's tonic action encourages a general recovery. The plant should not be used by pregnant women, however, since in large quantities it can induce a miscarriage. The leaves and flowering tops are antiseptic, antitussive, astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, pectoral, sedative, stimulant, stomachic, tonic and vasodilator. The plant can be harvested when in full flower and dried for later use. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment of flatulence, stomach-aches, upper respiratory tract infections, coughs in children etc. A poultice made from the fresh herb is used to heal wounds. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Its keyword is 'Stability'. This oil should not be used on people who are highly strung as it can cause epileptic symptoms. The essential oil should not be used internally except under professional supervision."" SOURCE

Lettuce - Marvel of Four Seasons,"Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce plant, also known as Lactuca sativa, is a popular variety of lettuce that is highly sought after by gardeners and salad enthusiasts. This unique lettuce variety is known for its beautiful red and green leaves, making it a visually appealing addition to any garden or salad bowl.

Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is a cool-season crop that thrives in mild climates and can be grown in both spring and fall. It is a loose-leaf lettuce variety, which means that the leaves grow in a loose, open head rather than forming a tight, compact head like other lettuce varieties.

One of the key features of Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is its exceptional taste. The leaves have a delicate, buttery flavor with a slight hint of bitterness, making it a versatile ingredient in salads, sandwiches, and wraps. Its crisp texture adds a refreshing crunch to any dish.

Growing Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is relatively easy, making it a great choice for both beginner and experienced gardeners. It prefers well-drained soil and requires regular watering to keep the soil moist. This lettuce variety can be grown in containers, raised beds, or directly in the ground.

When planting Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce, it is important to sow the seeds thinly and cover them with a thin layer of soil. The seeds should be spaced about 6 inches apart to allow room for the plants to grow. It is recommended to provide the plants with partial shade to protect them from excessive heat.

Harvesting Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is a rewarding experience. The leaves can be harvested individually as needed or the entire plant can be harvested at once. To harvest the leaves, simply cut them off at the base using a sharp knife or scissors. The plant will continue to produce new leaves, allowing for multiple harvests throughout the growing season.

Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is not only a delicious and visually appealing addition to your garden, but it is also packed with nutritional benefits. It is a good source of vitamins A and K, as well as folate and fiber. Adding this lettuce variety to your diet can contribute to a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

Whether you are a seasoned gardener or just starting out, Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is a fantastic choice for your garden. Its beautiful appearance, delicious taste, and nutritional benefits make it a must-have for any lettuce lover. Start growing your own Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce today and enjoy the satisfaction of harvesting your own fresh, homegrown lettuce.

Nasturtium - Alaska Mix,"This variety includes a mix of gold, salmon, orange, and deep red/purple colored flowers. 

Nasturtium flowers are one of the most popular edible flowers grown in home gardens. The petals have a slight peppery taste, and the seeds and leaves are also edible! You can even use the seeds as an alternative to capers.
 
Not only are the flowers pretty, Nasturtiums are great companion plants! They are also known to deter aphids, whiteflies, cucumber beetles & more. Learn more >
 
Nasturtiums should be planted in the spring for a ""summer show"". Plant in full sun, and in sandy, well drained soil. Generally, the poorer the soil quality, the more flowers the plant will produce! Deadhead your plants regularly to encourage new blooms, all season long. These flowers will self-seed resulting in more flowers for years to come!

Pepper (Hot) - Ancho Grande 🔥,"
The Ancho Grande Pepper is named for its size—ancho is wide, grande is big. That’s when it’s dark red. While it’s still dark green, it’s called Poblano, which is named for a town in Mexico.

This fleshy, thick-skinned pepper is traditionally used for chiles rellenos and mole sauce, but you can probably think of a few more uses while you’re studying for the quiz about its name.

Slender, glossy 5""-6"" fruits grow abundantly on strong plants, bounding through all the primary colors as it matures from green to yellow to orange to red. Primarily used as a dried spice, but can be used fresh to rev up a salsa or to make pickling brine howl.

"Pepper (Hot) - Cherry, Red 🔥🔥","
Before you toss this cute little Red Cherry Pepper into your mouth, remember that it’s affectionately called a cherry bomb. Vigorous plants ignite a barrage of firm fruits that ripen from dark green to bright red. Plump and smooth, crunchy and spicy, with a slightly sweet flavor. Makes a dynamite jelly, or charge them up with cream cheese for a big platter of poppers. 

The Red Cherry Sweet Pepper is just as cute and little, with no heat or bomb jargon.

Pepper (Hot) - Fresno Chili 🔥🔥,"


The Fresno Chili Pepper is a fun one to follow as it grows. The immature green fruit starts out pointing upward, and has a green, grassy flavor with mild heat. As the color changes through orange to bright red, the fruit hangs down, and the flavor changes to smoky and fruity with a bit more heat than a Jalapeño. These 3"" tapered peppers are large enough to stuff, and small enough to pickle. Traditionally used to liven up ceviche, but it’s okay to grill that fish instead and make tacos topped with Fresno chili sauce. Excellent for roasting on the BBQ - or even pickling.

And then it gets really hot for 10-15 minutes, finally subsiding after 30-40 minutes. Take care when handling, as the thin skin tears easily. Use the pepper as you dare.

Bushy and small plants will produce a large amount of peppers.

The peppers are yellow and then turn to red as the sweet flavor intensifies.

Excellent when pickled or eaten raw in salads or sandwiches.

Pepper (Hot) - Poblano 🔥,"
If you’re looking for the Chile Relleno pepper, you’ve found it. Except it goes by the name of Poblano. Prolific plants put out muchos 4""-8"" thick-skinned, tapered fruits that start out a deep dark green with mild heat and earthy flavor. That’s when this pepper (chile) is most often roasted, peeled, and stuffed full (relleno) of meat and cheese. Let it ripen on the vine and the color changes to a deep dark brownish-red that’s much spicier. Or dry it, and you’ll have an Ancho pepper to flake or powder. This one will keep your oven busy all summer long.

Pepper (Sweet) - White Cloud,"
What happens when you remove the color from a pepper? The White Cloud Pepper is what happens. A lovely ivory hue, inside and out, glossy and pearly and sometimes tinged with purple. Like the clouds in the sky, they vary in shape and size from small to medium. Its bell pepper nature can’t quite be tamed, however, so the fruit turns green and then bright orange or red when it matures. The flavor endures as well. Sweet and mild with no heat and a definite crunch. Now, what happens when a gardener grows that white sweet pepper?

How to Grow Sprouts

The easiest method is to grow sprouts in a Mason jar. To provide plenty of fresh air, cover the top with the mesh screen.

Step One: Soaking

For a quart-sized jar, put 1 ½ to 2 tablespoons of small seeds (up to 1 cup if using larger seeds like green peas or garbanzo) in the sprouting jar. Cover top of jar with cloth or sprouting lid and rinse the seeds in warm (not hot) water. Drain and refill so that water is about an inch above the seeds. Let the seeds soak 8-12 hours (overnight). Protect from light by covering with a dish towel or placing in a cupboard.

Step Two: Rinsing

Rinse 2 to 3 times per day for 2 to 3 days. After thoroughly draining the rinse water, lay the jar on its side to spread out the seeds. Do not expose to light. After 2 to 3 days the sprouts should be filling up the jar.


Things to Remember:

1. Rinse often (2-3 times/day).

2. Keep them moist, not wet.

3. Keep them at room temperature.

4. Give them air to breathe.

5. Don't grow too many in one container.

6. Keep them in a dark place.

Squash (Summer) - Lebanese White Bush,"The Lebanese Squash is a very popular heirloom squash variety that grows extremely quickly - only 45 days

 A summer squash variety from Lebenon

 Grows as a compact bush size plant (not as a vine)

Fast-growing summer squash produces large yields
Perfect for growing in small spaces
 Days to Maturity | 45 days



The Lebanese, White Squash is a favorite amongst many home gardeners. Most would recommend planting 2-4 bushes to feed a family throughout the season, while for smaller families or couples, 2 plants would be plenty. It really depends on how much squash you love to eat and whether or not you're growing other varieties at the same time. We do however recommend planting at least two plants for better pollination. The better the pollination, the better the fruit count! It's been reported that some gardeners have experienced up to 15 fruits per plant, however, that is on the high side. Most plants will produce 4-6 fruit, again depending on the pollination and other variables that come into play. There's just not an exact answer for this. You're almost at the mercy of mother nature on this, but most would agree it's a great producer! They're better picked when young and tender unless you're planning on stuffing them, then baking. In that case, they are let to grow larger, again, which will keep the plant from producing more fruit if you don't harvest regularly from them. So the bottom line is, if you want more fruit, harvest more regularly and when the squash is young and tender. This will send signals to the plant to bloom and flower again to keep reproducing. Generally, this plant will get 2-3 feet high, but regular fertilizing would, of course, alter these numbers as well. If your soil is in good condition with lots of healthy organic matter, you should have no problem getting plants that reach this size. May we suggest growing on black plastic for weed & insect control?

Wildflowers - All Perennial Scatter Garden Seed Mix,"Includes a mix of 16 popular perennial flower varieties and colors. Scatter this mix of seeds in your garden and enjoy a beautiful assortment of flowers for multiple years.

A perennial plant or simply perennial is a plant that lives for more than two years. The term is often used to differentiate a plant from shorter-lived annuals and biennials. Wikipedia



Wildflower establishment requires some important steps:


- Site selection/preparation: It's important to address competition from weeds: pull, till, or use organic herbicides. If planting in the spring/summer you can wait for weeds to germinate, control and then plant the wildflower seeds.


- Seeding:  You will want to have good seed to soil contact, broadcasting by hand is a good approach on small plot, may want to mix with an inert carrier, sand or other. Raking in and covering with soil 2-3 times seed thickness.


- Watering: During establishment for the first month, can be from rain in spring or supplement with irrigation.

Wildflowers - Exotic Mountain Scatter Garden Seed Mix,"Includes a mix of 17 of the most vibrant and beautiful flower varieties you've ever seen. Scatter this mix in your garden.  Specifically for elevations above 7,000 feet in western continental U.S.

Wildflower establishment requires some important steps:


- Site selection/preparation: It's important to address competition from weeds: pull, till, or use organic herbicides. If planting in the spring/summer you can wait for weeds to germinate, control and then plant the wildflower seeds.


- Seeding:  You will want to have good seed to soil contact, broadcasting by hand is a good approach on small plot, may want to mix with an inert carrier, sand or other. Raking in and covering with soil 2-3 times seed thickness.


- Watering: During establishment for the first month, can be from rain in spring or supplement with irrigation.


- Timing: The best time to plant is in spring to early summer and even again in late fall.
