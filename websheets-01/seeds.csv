Black Salsify (Black Oyster Plant/Scorzonera),"Black Salsify, also called¬†Scorzonera and Black Oyster Plant, is a cold hardy perennial in the aster and lettuce family grown for its thin root with rough black skin over white flesh that can grow 1'-3' long if it has the room. Take care when harvesting, as the roots are delicate and snap easily.¬† Any root left behind will re-grow!

It would be fun for a blind taste test, as the edible yellow dandelion-like flower petals smell like cocoa, the edible flower buds taste like okra, and the roots taste like oyster, asparagus, or artichoke, turning sweeter and earthier after a frost.

The stems and long, wide leaves that can grow 3'-4' tall are also edible. Delicious roasted, mashed, grilled, and pickled, or simply saut√©ed in a little butter for a rich, unusual side dish.

Caraway,"


Caraway is an ancient aromatic herb, famous for being the spice in rye bread and German sauerkraut. A biennial in the carrot family that grows 1'-3' tall, with feathery foliage and tiny white flowers.

While you‚Äôre waiting for the flowers, seeds, and roots to develop in the second year, spend the first year using the leaves, which have a parsley-dill flavor, in salads, soups, and saut√©s.

Caraway is a biennial. This means it takes two years for the plant to mature, produce seeds, then die. During the winter you may not see any evidence of the plant even though the roots are preparing for spring. So mark your spot carefully so you don‚Äôt accidentally dig them up in the spring.

An interesting legend that goes along with Caraway is that it had the power to prevent the theft of objects that had seeds nearby and it also kept lovers from losing interest in one another.¬† Still, some believe Caraway has beneficial healing powers and you can use the oil, fruit and seeds as medicine.







Health Benefits of Caraway

Women can use Caraway oil to relieve menstral cramps. Feeling bloated or have a bit of indigestion? Chewing on a few Caraway seeds can help relieve your symptoms!

Ways to Consume Caraway


If you want to consume the leaves, pick them when they are young and tender. The roots are also edible when the plant is young.¬† Use Caraway seeds in baked goods, such as breads, and buns.¬† Add them to vegetable and fruit dishes, especially curries.¬† Use leaves and seeds alike to make hot and cold teas.

Caraway seeds have a sharp, pungent, slightly licorice taste¬†that‚Äôs is¬†delicious with green beans, potatoes, cabbage, onions, brussels sprouts, tomatoes, and apples. Try mixing it with cucumber and sour cream. It‚Äôs delicious with sausage and beef.

"Chamomile, German","


German Chamomile has been cultivated as a medicinal herb for thousands of years and was used by ancient Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, and Vikings. An easy care annual in the daisy family, it has small white flowers with large yellow hollow cone centers that proliferate on a bushy shrub of feathery foliage. Only the sweet apple-scented flowers are used fresh or dried, usually steeped into a soothing herbal tea that can be used as a facial tonic or sipped by kids and adults right before it‚Äôs time to go night-night.

As a companion plant, it attracts pollinators and beneficial insects; repels cabbage moths, cabbage white fly, cabbage worms, cucumber beetles, and mosquitoes; and is said to increase the fragrance and flavor of aromatic herbs such as basil, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage, and thyme.

Roman Chamomile has many of the same uses, but is a low-growing, evergreen perennial groundcover with fewer, but larger flowers. You can determine which type of Chamomile you have if you cut open the yellow center of the flower. Roman has solid centers while German has hollow ones.

As a medicinal herb, Chamomile has been used internally to treat allergies, anxiety, arthritis, asthma, colds, colic, cough, flatulence, gum disease, headache, indigestion, inflammation, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), menstrual cramps, morning sickness, stress, nervousness, restlessness, and stomach upset, and externally to treat burns, earache, hemorrhoids, mouth sores, skin problems, sunburns, teething pain, tired eyes, toothache, and wounds.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not handle or ingest if you are allergic to ragweed.

‚ö†Ô∏è Medicinal properties are presented as information only, and are not a recommendation or prescription for use. Consult a medical professional before using any herb medicinally.

Roman Chamomile, also called English Chamomile, has been cultivated as a medicinal herb since Medieval times. This hardy, aromatic, mat-forming groundcover perennial in the daisy family produces small white flowers with large yellow solid cone centers and aromatic, fern-like foliage. Easily spreads through both reseeding and creeping roots, and can become invasive. Use it to fill in space between stones or pavers, or create a fragrant, low-maintenance ‚Äúchamomile lawn‚Äù like the royals do at Buckingham Palace. Both the apple-scented flowers and stems are used fresh or dried, and steeped into a calming herbal tea sipped before beddy-bye time.

Apple fragrance
Grows 3""-6"" tall
Can be invasive
Good for containers

As a companion plant, it attracts pollinators and beneficial insects; repels cabbage moths, cabbage white fly, cabbage worms, cucumber beetles, and mosquitoes; and is said to increase the fragrance and flavor of aromatic herbs such as basil, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage, and thyme.

German Chamomile has many of the same uses as Roman Chamomile, but it‚Äôs a tall, bushy annual with more, but smaller flowers. You can determine which type of Chamomile you have if you cut open the yellow center of the flower. German has hollow centers while Roman has solid ones.

As a medicinal herb, Chamomile has been used internally to treat allergies, anxiety, arthritis, asthma, colds, colic, cough, flatulence, gum disease, headache, indigestion, inflammation, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), menstrual cramps, morning sickness, stress, nervousness, restlessness, and stomach upset, and externally to treat burns, earache, hemorrhoids, mouth sores, skin problems, sunburns, teething pain, tired eyes, toothache, and wounds.

This easy care bushy perennial reseeds easily, isn‚Äôt fussy about soil or water, and can grow just about anywhere. Puts out bright, showy 2""-4"" flower clusters in brilliant red-orange with yellow centers on slender stems that grow 2'-3' tall. Blooms continuously summer through fall, providing migrating monarchs with nectar snacks for their long journey and a place to lay their eggs. Can be grown as an annual in cooler grow zones. Lovely and long-lasting in cut flower arrangements.


Life cycle: Herbaceous perennial
Bloom season: Summer, fall
Attracts: Beneficial insects, hummingbirds, bees, butterflies, and other pollinators
Flower meaning: Dignity, freedom, rejection, remembrance, solitude

As a medicinal plant, Milkweed has been used internally to treat diarrhea, gonorrhea, intestinal parasites and worms, pneumonia, spleen inflammation, and stomach tumors, and externally to treat bleeding, boils, corns, dermatitis, eye infections, ringworm, skin parasites, snakebites, sores, warts, and wounds.

‚ö†Ô∏è Although Milkweed is known to be safe when used correctly, all parts of the plant are toxic and may even cause death to people, pets, horses, and livestock if ingested in large quantities. The milky sap is a skin irritant. Do not ingest while pregnant or nursing.

‚ö†Ô∏è Medicinal properties are presented as information only, and are not a recommendation or prescription for use. Consult a medical professional before using any plant medicinally.

NOTE: A parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE), travels with monarchs and is deposited on every plant they visit. In warm grow zones where this non-native milkweed does not die back from a killing frost, the OE parasite can build up and harm the caterpillars that feed on the leaves and the butterflies they become. A continuously blooming milkweed may also encourage the monarchs to dally rather than migrate, which interrupts their reproductive cycle. It‚Äôs easy to eliminate both dangers, by cutting your plants to the ground at least once per season.

Can grow 1'-2' tall and 12""-18"" wide, and prefers cooler weather. The entire plant contains saponins, with the highest concentration in the roots, which make a gentle foamy lather when mixed with warm water, and is used as detergent or soap to clean skin, hair, and delicate fabrics. Also called Bouncing Bet, a historical expression for a laundry woman. Reseeding and runner roots enable it to spread easily and it can become invasive.

As a medicinal plant, Soapwort has been used internally to treat bronchitis, colds, cough, diarrhea, kidney stones, and respiratory problems, and externally to treat acne, boils, burns, eczema, inflammation, itchy skin, muscle pain, poison ivy, psoriasis, rash, and wounds.

 Day to Maturity | 75 days

Additional Details


""Currently an undervalued herb, it is often used as a household remedy, particularly as an expectorant and stomach tonic. It has a positive effect when used to treat bronchitis and respiratory infections, especially where there is excessive mucous production. Hyssop can irritate the mucous membranes, so it is best given after an infection has peaked, when the herb's tonic action encourages a general recovery. The plant should not be used by pregnant women, however, since in large quantities it can induce a miscarriage. The leaves and flowering tops are antiseptic, antitussive, astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, pectoral, sedative, stimulant, stomachic, tonic and vasodilator. The plant can be harvested when in full flower and dried for later use. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment of flatulence, stomach-aches, upper respiratory tract infections, coughs in children etc. A poultice made from the fresh herb is used to heal wounds. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Its keyword is 'Stability'. This oil should not be used on people who are highly strung as it can cause epileptic symptoms. The essential oil should not be used internally except under professional supervision.""¬†SOURCE

Lettuce - Marvel of Four Seasons,"Marvel of Four Seasons¬†lettuce plant, also known as¬†Lactuca sativa, is a popular variety of lettuce that is highly sought after by gardeners and salad enthusiasts.

Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is a cool-season crop that thrives in mild climates and can be grown in both spring and fall. It is a loose-leaf lettuce variety, which means that the leaves grow in a loose, open head rather than forming a tight, compact head like other lettuce varieties.

It prefers well-drained soil and requires regular watering to keep the soil moist. This lettuce variety can be grown in containers, raised beds, or directly in the ground.

When planting Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce, it is important to sow the seeds thinly and cover them with a thin layer of soil. The seeds should be spaced about 6 inches apart to allow room for the plants to grow. It is recommended to provide the plants with partial shade to protect them from excessive heat.

Harvesting Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is a rewarding experience. The leaves can be harvested individually as needed or the entire plant can be harvested at once. To harvest the leaves, simply cut them off at the base using a sharp knife or scissors. The plant will continue to produce new leaves, allowing for multiple harvests throughout the growing season.

Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is not only a delicious and visually appealing addition to your garden, but it is also packed with nutritional benefits. It is a good source of vitamins A and K, as well as folate and fiber. Adding this lettuce variety to your diet can contribute to a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

Whether you are a seasoned gardener or just starting out, Marvel of Four Seasons lettuce is a fantastic choice for your garden. Its beautiful appearance, delicious taste, and nutritional benefits make it a must-have for any lettuce lover.

Typically in the 6""-10"" range, these wide, tapered summer icicles grow on compact plants and ripen from lime green to smoky crimson. Sweet and flavorful with a pleasurable crackle of heat. When roasted or grilled, the thick skin slips off easily, leaving tender, juicy, meaty flesh. If you do grow a Jim that needs a tape measure, fill one full of ham and havarti or crab and cream cheese, and feed your entire family plus a neighbor kid.

Pepper (Hot) - Fresno Chili üî•üî•,"


The Fresno Chili Pepper is a fun one to follow as it grows. The immature green fruit starts out pointing upward, and has a green, grassy flavor with mild heat. As the color changes through orange to bright red, the fruit hangs down, and the flavor changes to smoky and fruity with a bit more heat than a Jalape√±o. These 3"" tapered peppers are large enough to stuff, and small enough to pickle. Traditionally used to liven up ceviche, but it‚Äôs okay to grill that fish instead and make tacos topped with Fresno chili sauce. Excellent for roasting on the BBQ - or even pickling.

How to Grow Sprouts

The easiest method is to grow sprouts in a Mason jar. To provide plenty of fresh air, cover the top with the mesh screen.

Step One: Soaking

For a quart-sized jar, put 1 ¬Ω to 2 tablespoons of small seeds (up to 1 cup if using larger seeds like green peas or garbanzo) in the sprouting jar. Cover top of jar with cloth or sprouting lid and rinse the seeds in warm (not hot) water. Drain and refill so that water is about an inch above the seeds. Let the seeds soak 8-12 hours (overnight). Protect from light by covering with a dish towel or placing in a cupboard.

Step Two: Rinsing

Rinse 2 to 3 times per day for 2 to 3 days. After thoroughly draining the rinse water, lay the jar on its side to spread out the seeds. Do not expose to light. After 2 to 3 days the sprouts should be filling up the jar.


Things to Remember:

1. Rinse often (2-3 times/day).

2. Keep them moist, not wet.

3. Keep them at room temperature.

4. Give them air to breathe.

5. Don't grow too many in one container.

6. Keep them in a dark place.

Squash (Summer) - Lebanese White Bush,"The Lebanese Squash is a very popular heirloom squash variety that grows extremely quickly - only 45 days

Very flavorful and widely grown in the Middle East

 A summer squash variety from Lebenon

 Grows as a compact bush size plant (not as a vine)

Fast-growing summer squash produces large yields
Perfect for growing in small spaces
 Days to Maturity | 45 days



The Lebanese, White Squash is a favorite¬†amongst many home gardeners. Most would recommend planting 2-4 bushes to feed a family throughout the season, while for smaller families or couples, 2 plants would be plenty. It really depends on how much squash you love to eat and whether or not you're growing other varieties at the same time. We do however recommend planting at least two plants for better pollination. The better the pollination, the better the fruit count! It's been reported that some gardeners have experienced up to 15 fruits per plant, however, that is on the high side. Most plants will produce 4-6 fruit, again depending on the pollination and other variables that come into play. There's just not an exact answer for this. You're almost at the mercy of mother nature on this, but most would agree it's a great producer! They're better picked when young and tender unless you're planning on stuffing them, then baking. In that case, they are let to grow larger, again, which will keep the plant from producing more fruit if you don't harvest regularly from them. So the bottom line is, if you want more fruit, harvest more regularly and when the squash is young and tender. This will send signals to the plant to bloom and flower again to keep reproducing. Generally, this plant will get 2-3 feet high, but regular fertilizing would, of course, alter these numbers as well. If your soil is in good condition with lots of healthy organic matter, you should have no problem getting plants that reach this size. May we suggest growing on black plastic for weed & insect control?
