"Beet, Sugar (Beta vulgaris) - 50 Seeds","Sugar beets represent about 54% of domestically produced sugar and is a vegan friendly sugar source as it does not require the bone char that is necessary for sugarcane to be processed. When fully grown, a sugar beet is about a foot long, weighs two-to-five pounds, and is about 18% sucrose. They can also be cooked and tossed into green salads, substituted for white potatoes in latke recipes, or roasted as a side dish.

About Sugar Beet sugar:
White table sugar comes from either sugarcane or sugar beets and is usually sold without its plant source clearly identified. This is because—chemically speaking—the two products are identical. Refined table sugar is pure, crystallized sucrose, much in the same way that pure salt is simply sodium chloride. Sucrose is found naturally in honey, dates, and sugar maple sap, but it is most concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beets. The refining process renders the original plant irrelevant as the sucrose is completely extracted from the plant that produced it. <br>However, distinguishing between cane and beet sugar is not completely a marketing ploy and is fairly common on sugars sold in health food stores. In order to make sugarcane crystals pure white, the sugar is usually processed with bone char; beet sugar does not require this step. Although the final sugarcane product does not have bone in it, this distinction is important to many vegans and other vegetarians who seek to minimize animal suffering.

"Broccoli, Romanesco (Brassica oleracea) - 100 Seeds","The Romanesco, which is sometimes called Romanesco Broccoli or Roman Cauliflower, did not always exist in nature. Many botanists think that farmers in Italy in the 1600s used selective breeding to make it happen. It's actually a flower that you can eat. It comes from the same family as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. It tastes a lot like cauliflower, but a little bit nuttier and earthier. The most interesting thing about Romanesco is, of course, how it looks. Its spiraling buds look like a fractal, which means that each bud in the spiral is made up of a group of smaller buds.

Sow 1.5"" and cover each one with moist soil, leaving 1 1/2 feet between the plants and 2 feet between the rows. Water them often, with two inches of water each week. When the heads begin to harden, they are ready for harvest. This occurs between 75-80 days, so keep an eye on them. To harvest the heads, do so by removing the entire plant, root and all. This will keep the soil healthy and prevent disease, so that you can continue to grow bountiful harvests.

Caper seeds are very tiny and dormant. Dried seeds are more difficult to germinate, so soak for one day in warm water and then cold stratify in the refrigerator for 2-3 months. After the cold cycle, re-soak the seed overnight before sowing at a depth of .5"" in a very well draining medium. For northern growers, it's often best to start them in a large pot with a base of coarse rock or crumbled brick. Take care not to overwater as this plant's foliage is a natural water conservator. They will need sunlight to flourish and temps of -20°F or lower will kill them, so bring the pot indoors or put in a greenhouse. When transplanting, be sure to not disturb the roots as little as possible. Before moving plant outside, be sure to ""harden off"" for a week to allow the plant to adjust to the new environment.

Growing Instructions:
Untreated sweet corn seed will not germinate in cold wet soil. Please be patient and wait till soil warms to at least 60° before sowing, or start seedlings indoors and transplant at 3–6"" before taproots take off. Minimum soil temperature 50°, optimal temperature range 60–95°. Tender, will not survive frost. Sow 4 seed per foot in rows 3' apart. Thin to the strongest seedling 1' apart. Thinned seedlings can be transplanted elsewhere if done before the taproots establish. When corn is knee-high, sidedress with azomite or alfalfa meal to stimulate growth. General rule of thumb with corn is to plant at least 4 rows to ensure adequate pollination to keep crops going. If you lack sufficient space for enough plants for good pollination, try hand-pollinating by cutting off the tassels and shaking their pollen onto the silks. Sweet corn is ready 18–24 days after the first silks show, the exact time dependent on the weather. Press ears 2"" from the tips to assess kernel fullness. Harvest when the kernels are plump, soft, tender and filled with a milky juice. Most sugary enhanced varieties have an optimal picking window of 5–7 days.

"Corn, Stowells Evergreen Sweet (Zea mays) - 30 Seeds","This white variety was first developed in Burlington, New Jersey in 1848 by Nathaniel Newman Stowell. As a farmer, Stowell spent some years refining this variety, which was developed by crossing Menomony Soft Corn and Northern Sugar Corn. One close friend purchased two ears of seed corn for $4 in the fall of 1855, on the understanding that the seed would only be used for personal purposes. Later that year, Stowell's ""friend"" resold the same seed to Thoburn and Company for a whopping $20,00 which is the equivalent to nearly $800,000 today. It was then released commercially and now with over 160 years of history, this delightful white sweet corn variety is regarded as the ""King of All White Sweet Corn Varieties"". In addition to producing 9-inch ears with 16 to 20 rows of plump, sweet white kernels, Stowell's Evergreen matures over a long period of time, extending the normal harvest time.

When 2-3 leaves appear on each plant, cut off all but the strongest seedling with scissors per pot. Harden off before transplanting. They should be planted no sooner than one week after the last spring frost when the air temperature is consistently 65-70°. Cucumbers like full sun and very rich soil. For direct sowing, plant them in a hill of soil, sowing 7-8 seeds in each hill with hills spaced 4-5' apart. If rows are preferable, plant 5 seeds per hill 1 foot apart and later thin them. Cucumbers love heat and cannot endure even a light frost, so cover if cold weather threatens.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Thrives in heat
•USDA Zones: 3-12

Description:
The edamame, also known as soybean, originated in East Asia and is a legume that can be grown in zones three through nine. The beans have a high amount of fiber and protein, with a salty taste, and many people enjoy eating them on their own due to their strong flavor. The plants grow in a tall, bushy manner with many leaves of a dark green color, which can look great as part of your garden. Be Sweet Edamame will produce 2-inch pods with 3 beans per pod. Edamame has been a popular dish in Chinese cuisine since ancient times, but now the whole world has caught on to the delicious flavor of a hot bowl of steamed and salted edamame.


Health Benefits:
This food is very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium. It is also a good source of Protein, Vitamin A, Thiamine, Riboflavin, Iron, Phosphorus and Potassium, and a very good source of Vitamin C, Folate, Magnesium and Manganese.


Growing Instructions:
Two weeks after the last frost of the season, sow the seeds 1"" deep in a light, well-draining soil that is at least 60°. You’ll want to give about 12"" of space between the plants. While growing, the plant should have 2 1/2 inches of water a week. The plants can grow to be up to 3 feet tall, so they may benefit from having a source of support, such as a pole or trellis. Although edamame beans are practically immune to many small pests, animals such as rabbits and dears like nibbling on them, so it would be a good idea to protect the plants with something like a bird net. You can pick the pods when they are plump and still green in color; waiting until they turn yellow will give them a flavor similar to lima beans. This plant loves sun; place in a sunny location with well-drained soil. Sow seeds every two weeks for consistent harvesting. After 10 days, the plants should poke through the soil.

To begin, poke a hole .5"" deep in each pot or tray that you are using and sow two seeds in each. Lightly cover the seeds and place the pots or trays by a window with full sunlight. Eggplant needs moist soil to thrive, so keep the soil watered. Once you see two sets of leaves sprouting up, thin them out by cutting the weaker of the two down to soil level. After transplanting outdoors, you should water the Black Beauty eggplants every day to keep the soil moist. Since the crops can become heavy, it can be helpful to use a post, pole, or other support. When the globes are glossy, you can harvest them by snipping them off the vine.

Description:
This Italian heirloom eggplant produces a great yield of firm mild flesh eggplants in that are 8-10"" long by 2"" wide similar to the size of your typical cucumber. This is a great option for those looking for a milder tasting eggplant. Interesting fact... although eggplant is considered a vegetable, it is actually classified as a berry.


Growing Instructions:
Though gardeners with long growing seasons will be able to direct sow their eggplant seed when the soil reaches 70°F, starting the seed indoors is best in most areas. About 8-10 weeks before the last expected spring frost, plant these long purple eggplant seeds in pots 1/4"" deep. Keep them in a sunny window or under a grow light, maintaining a temperature of around 80 degrees. Germination of eggplant can be spotty, and may take several weeks. Keep the seedlings moist and provide organic matter for the best development. Gradually expose them to the elements by leaving the pots outdoors during the day. When the average air and soil temperature reach 70 degrees, or about 3 weeks after the last frost, plant the seedlings in well drained soil in full sun; for fullest growth, allow each plant 2-3' in all directions. Eggplant also grows very well in container gardens; most northern gardeners depend on this method in order to succeed in growing this heat loving plant. Eggplant thrives in the full heat of summer; row covers, black plastic, or other methods to conserve heat may be necessary in some climates. If temperatures threaten to fall below 55 degrees F, cover the plants. As soon as the seedlings become established, mulch them to conserve moisture and control weeds. Keep the soil evenly moist, and apply fertilizer or organic matter once monthly.

This particular variety of kale makes excellent kale chips! Bake with a splash of oil and your favorite spice mix.


Growing Instructions:
Kale prefers a fertile, well-drained soil high in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0–7.5. Consistent moisture will produce the best quality leaves.
Direct Seed: Plant from early spring to approximately 3 months before expected fall frost. For bunching, sow 3–4 seeds every 12–18"", ½"" deep, in rows 18–36"" apart. Thin to 1 plant per group. For baby leaf production, sow 60 seeds/ft. in a 2–4"" wide band ¼–½"" deep.

EARLY SPRING CROP:
Sow 2 seeds per cell or 3–4 seeds per inch in 20-row flats, or in outdoor beds ¼"" deep. Seedlings should be ready to transplant in 4–6 weeks. If possible keep soil temperature over 75°F until germination then reduce air temperature to about 60°F (16°C). Transplant outdoors 12–18"" apart in rows 18–36"" apart. Kale prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55–75°F (13–24°C), optimum being 60–70°F (16–21°C), but will produce good crops under warmer, summer conditions.

FALL CROP:
Start seedlings as above and transplant to the garden in June–early August. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop earlier in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Biennial grown as annual
•USDA Zones: 3-12

Description:
As the name suggests, ""Dwarf Siberian"" Kale is generally a cool weather Kale, but it will also grow surprisingly well in more temperate climates. Easy-to-grow by direct seed or transplant. Frost-tolerant and winter hardy. Wants evenly moist soil and will grow in full sun or with partial shade. Can be planted in spring, late summer and early fall in succession plantings for nearly year-round harvest. Flavor improves in cold weather. The Dwarf Siberian Kale is excellent for use in salads and stir fry.

Growing Instructions:
Kale can be planted at any time, from early spring to early summer. Be mindful, as hot weather makes kale bitter. If planted late in the summer, you can harvest it from fall until the ground freezes. Plant ¼ to ½ inch deep in an area with well-drained, loamy soil. If planting in cool season, select an area that will get full sun. Choose partial shade if growing in the warm season. Seeds will sprout best in soil around 70 degrees F. After 2 weeks, thin seedlings so they are spaced 8 to 12 inches apart. Water the plants regularly, but take care not to over water. Mulch the soil heavily after first freeze. The plants can sometimes produce leaves throughout the winter. Kale is ready to harvest when the leaves are about the size of your hands. Avoid picking the terminal bud at the top center of the plant, as this will keep the plant productive. Only pick about a fistful of leaves per harvest. Kale grows until it’s about 20 degrees F - a touch of frost actually sweetens the flavor.

Growing Instructions:
Direct sow early April until mid-May for a crop to mature in about 8 weeks. Sow again mid-July to early August for fall and winter crops. Planting between mid-May and mid-July causes them to mature in hot weather resulting in inferior bulbs. Optimal soil temperature for germination is 50-85°F. Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days. Sow seeds ¼” deep with plants spaced 4-6″ apart in rows 12-18″ apart. Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Kohlrabi is a moderate to heavy feeder that does best in humus-rich soil amended with composted manure. Mix ¼-½ cup complete organic fertilizer into the soil under each plant. Spring-sown kohlrabi will get larger than tennis balls in fair soil, but if you pick them when they are still less than 2-3″ in diameter they will be sweet and tender. Fall-grown kohlrabi can grow larger yet stay tender. Kohlrabi is frost-hardy and may last well beyond Christmas in the garden.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds

Description:
American Flag Leek is a classic leek and the predominant choice for home gardeners. A close relative of both onion and garlic, leeks are most commonly used in soups and stews, but can also be used effectively in salads. Considered an ""overwintering"" variety, American Flag Leeks were bred to endure cold Northeastern winters.

Growing Instructions:
Start leeks indoors 2-3 months before the last frost of spring sowing them 1/4"" deep in flats at 60-70°. When they reach a height of 2"", transplant the seedlings into separate pots. Transplant them in rich soil and full sun about a week after the last frost when they are roughly 6-12"" tall. Dig holes 1-2 feet apart and deep enough so that the plant only emerges several inches out of the soil. Water the seedlings and fill the hole with loose dirt. Does amazing well with celery, onions and carrots as companion plants. As leeks mature, most gardeners blanch the stalks by mounding up dirt or mulch around them. This technique gives the leeks improved flavor and also allows them to grow well past the first frost of fall. Keep soil evenly moist and apply compost or organic material once a month since leeks thrive in very rich soil. Harvest the leeks as soon as they reach a desirable size for eating.

One of the best winter-hardy leeks you can grow. This Scottish heirloom has provided families with hearty soups and stews since the 1830s. An old dependable leek that produces thick white stalks 2–3 inches in diameter. The mild flavor and smooth, tender stalks explain why this variety has been passed from one generation to the next.

Growing Instructions:
Start leeks indoors 2-3 months before the last frost of spring sowing them 1/4"" deep in flats at 60-70°. When they reach a height of 2"", transplant the seedlings into separate pots. Transplant them in rich soil and full sun about a week after the last frost when they are roughly 6-12"" tall. Dig holes 1-2 feet apart and deep enough so that the plant only emerges several inches out of the soil. Water the seedlings and fill the hole with loose dirt. Does amazing well with celery, onions and carrots as companion plants. As leeks mature, most gardeners blanch the stalks by mounding up dirt or mulch around them. This technique gives the leeks improved flavor and also allows them to grow well past the first frost of fall. Keep soil evenly moist and apply compost or organic material once a month since leeks thrive in very rich soil. Harvest the leeks as soon as they reach a desirable size for eating.

"Leek, Wild - Wild Ramps (Allium tricoccum) - 10 Seeds","The popular edible wild leek, often known as ""ramps,"" is a springtime delicacy that can be found in fine hardwood forests from the Midwest to the Northeast and south to Virginia. Early spring sees a bulb produce the broad flat leaves with burgundy stems. With a faint onion flavor, the leaves and bulbs are both edible. By the middle of the summer, the lovely foliage starts to fall back, and a 10"" flower stalk starts to grow from the base. The flower buds develop a white, onion-like umbel in June and July after emerging from their papery sheath. The pearly black seed heads that can last all the way into the fall replace the flowers that faded later in the summer.

•USDA Zones: 3-8

Planting Instructions:
It takes two winters for wild leek seed to emerge from the soil because wild leek seeds are ""double dormant."" Despite germinating after their first winter, ramp seeds develop only their roots in their first year; leaves do not appear until the second year after planting. Using leaf litter, cover the seeds lightly with a few inches of soil to mimic the natural process. You can accelerate seed germination by mixing the seed with moist sand and storing it in the refrigerator for 30-60 days, then in a 70-75 degree location for 30-60 days, followed by another 30-60 day period in the refrigerator. Each pot should be sown with 2-3 wild leek seeds and kept lightly moist until they germinate. Plant the seedlings 4-6"" apart once the foliage is tall enough to handle safely. For bigger clumps, plant 2-3 seedlings together. At all stages of their growth, wild leeks need adequate moisture; this greatly affects the germination and growth rate, as well as the quality of the plant.

•Heat resistant
•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•45 Days to Maturity
•USDA Zones: 3-9

Description:
One of the most popular salad lettuces, this heirloom variety is one of the best buttercrunch varieties you'll find. Bibb Lettuce produces abundant yields of crisp and delicious lettuce that is amazing in a salad, used as a lettuce wrap or on the grill. Developed by Cornell University more than 60 years ago, it has quickly become a favorite because unlike most lettuce varieties that need cooler temperatures, Summer Bibb lettuce can be grown in in cooler temperatures as well as in warmer climates and even in the summer!


Growing Instructions:
Buttercrunch lettuce can be sowed directly into the garden, or started indoors.

EARLY HARVEST: Start indoors several weeks before the last frost and transplant the seedlings to the garden after the last frost threat. You can also direct sow into the garden after the last frost. For indoor starts, sow a few seeds in each cell of a seed tray. Cover very lightly with a fine starter soil. Keep soil moist during the germination period. Fast sprouting seedlings should emerge in about 5-10 days. For direct sowing, start by sowing the seeds 1/8 inch in soil, one inch apart, in rows twelve to eighteen inches apart. Make sure to allow enough space between seeds for the lettuce to grow, as overcrowding can cause the lettuce to have a bitter taste. Firm the soil lightly. While growing, keep the soil well watered. Harvest between 45 days after planting, and before flowers appear, to ensure the lettuce doesn't become too mature.

FALL HARVEST: For your fall crop, an indoor start is best. Lettuce seeds do not germinate well in the hot soil of mid-summer. Follow the above mentioned indoor instructions.

Description:
The Cimarron is a very beautifully colored romaine lettuce! This tasty lettuce has bright green-red leaves that fade to deep red tips. This romaine type lettuce has good disease and bolt resistance. Cimarron is a favorite among gardeners for its beautiful hue and crispy texture in salad mixes!

Growing Instructions (USDA Zones 3-9):
Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65°F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60–65°F.

For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40°F), but poorly above 75°F. Sow seeds 2-3″ apart, rows 12–18″ apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8″, and firm soil gently. Thin to one plant every 10–12″. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination.

For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4″ deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of the sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2–3 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20°F. Transplant to 10–12″ apart, in rows 18″ apart.

Watering: Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.

Growing Instructions (USDA Zones 3-9):
As soon as the ground is workable in the spring, sow the seeds 1/2 inch deep in soil, 12"" apart, in rows 18"" apart. Likewise, you can start the seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before transplanting out when there is 4-6 mature leaves and a developed root system and water thoroughly after transplanting. For a fall crop, start sowing 8 weeks before the first fall frost. Germinates best in soil that is 55-65°. Make sure to allow enough space between seeds for the lettuce to grow, as overcrowding can cause the lettuce to have a bitter taste. Firm the soil lightly. While growing, keep the soil well watered. Harvest 70 to 79 days after planting. They prefer cooler weather, but need sunlight to grow properly. If they heat up too fast, or too early, iceberg lettuce could prematurely bolt, or go to seed. They are best when harvested just before this point, when the inner leaves are firm. Consider planting rows of chives or garlic between your lettuce to control aphids. They act as “barrier plants” for the lettuce.

Description:
Iceberg lettuce gained widespread popularity in the 1920s, when it was grown in the Salinas Valley of California and then shipped around the U.S. by train on ice, which is what earned it its name. Since then it’s become one of if not the most popular lettuce, gracing restaurants and dinner tables all over with its crunchy texture. Iceberg is a head lettuce, meaning it grows in a ball rather than leafy form, and it is known for its comparatively small, densely packed heads. The outer leaves are bright green in color, while the inner leaves and heart are light green to yellow and sometimes even white.

Parris Island Cos is crisp, flavorful, and has the highest nutritional value of our lettuce varieties! Upright plants form 10"" neatly folded heads of lettuce with dark green leaves and a creamy white heart. It has good uniformity with good resistance to tip burn, mosaic virus, and bolting. It is named after Parris Island in South Carolina and developed by the USDA and Clemson University around 1950. This nutritional, 10""-12"", upright lettuce will soon be a favorite in your garden and your kitchen, full grown or as a baby green.


Growing Instructions:
Parris Island Cos Romaine Lettuce grows well in cool weather, so the first crop can be direct sown when the soil temperature reaches at least 35 degrees F, or as soon as the soil can be worked. If the soil temperature rises above 75 degrees F, heirloom Parris Island Cos romaine lettuce seeds become dormant. Direct sow the seed in rich soil and full sun, spreading them as thinly as possible in rows 1-2' apart; when the seedlings begin to grow, thin them to a distance of 10-12"". Succession crops can be grown for fresh lettuce all season in areas with cool summers or warm winters; this is accomplished by planting a new crop every 2 weeks. Since lettuce has very shallow roots, it needs adequate moisture in order to stay tender and sweet; keep the soil evenly moist. Applying mulch helps conserve moisture and control weeds.

Maca (lepidium meyenii) - 25 Seeds,"Maca (lepidium meyenii) -25 Seeds

•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds

Description:
Also known as Peruvian Ginseng or Pepperweed, Lepidium Meyenii is an herb native to the high Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The leaves of this plant form rosettes atop a taproot that resembles a turnip albeit smaller reaching two to three inches in diameter. This species has been used for centuries dating back to Incan warriors who took the herb before battle. Also known as Maca, this highly nutritious plant is said to improve strength and endurance. It is also distributed around the world as an aphrodisiac. In addition to these benefits, maca is widely used as an edible in its native region for both humans and livestock.

Growing Instructions:
Keep seeds dry and cool. At 60F, maca seeds will retain germination above 80% for two years, falling to about 50% in years 3 and 4, and then dropping off fairly dramatically thereafter. Cooler storage conditions would probably extend life. Maca can be grown from seed unproblematically. The plant is considered to be extremely robust, because in nature it is exposed to the extreme climatic conditions of the Andes (temperature variations, strong winds and intense UV radiation). In the wild, it grows best when its seeds germinate before the rainy season. Maca seeds should be pressed about half a centimeter deep into the soil and watered immediately. After the sowing and during the entire growth phase the substrate should be kept cool and moist.

"Marjoram, Sweet (Origanum majorana) - 100 Seeds","Marjoram (Origanum majorana) - 100 Seeds

•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Bee Friendly
•Butterfly Friendly

Description:
One of the most popular culinary herbs, marjoram’s delicate, citrusy flavor makes it especially versatile. Marjoram is an aromatic herb in the mint (Lamiaceae) family that has been cultivated for thousands of years. In Greek mythology, marjoram was grown by the goddess Aphrodite. The fuzzy, green, oval-shape leaves grow opposite from each other, forming distinctive clusters, or knots (it’s also known as knotted marjoram). Native to the Mediterranean, North Africa, and western Asia, marjoram is often called sweet marjoram to distinguish it from oregano varieties like wild marjoram (Origanum vulgare) and pot marjoram (Origanum onites), aka Turkish oregano. The primary flavor compounds in marjoram are sabinene (fresh, woody), terpinene (citrusy), and linalool (floral). Marjoram has a milder flavor than oregano and tastes similar to thyme, but sweeter and with a stronger scent. It’s warm, slightly sharp, and a little bitter.

Culinary Uses:
Marjoram can be wrapped in cheesecloth with other herbs to create an aromatic sachet for braises and stews, or sprinkled fresh onto vegetable side dishes. Dried marjoram is a popular addition to salad dressings, meat dishes, and preserved meats such as German sausage. Used in both fresh and dried form, marjoram is subtler than its relative oregano and well suited to delicate vegetables, tomato-based dishes, such as tomato sauce and pizza, and poultry seasoning. Marjoram is an important component of spice blends.

Medicinal Uses:
It is also used as a “nerve tonic” and a “heart tonic,” and to promote better blood circulation. Marjoram oil is used for coughs, gall bladder complaints, stomach cramps and digestive disorders, dizziness, migraines, nervous headaches, nerve pain, paralysis, coughs, runny nose; and as a “water pill.”

Growing Instructions:
In short growing seasons, start marjoram inside about a month before the last frost. Sow the seeds just below the surface of the soil and keep evenly moist at 65-75°. Germination can take up to 3-4 weeks. Transplant well after the last frost since marjoram cannot tolerate cold. Place the seedlings 10-12"" apart in light, well drained soil and full sun. Marjoram can also be direct sown after the last frost planting the seeds 6-8"" apart and thinning the seedlings to 10-12"". Marjoram also grows exceptionally well as a container plant or house plant. Marjoram is extremely easy to care for preferring slightly dry soil and strong sunlight. Harvest the leaves and sprigs when plant reaches 6"" tall.

•Heirloom
•Open Pollinated
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•USDA Zone 3-9

Description:
Canary Melon seeds grow a long and luscious vine that will produce bright yellow melons. The melons have a sweet taste, similar to that of a honeydew melon. The Canary Melon does best in full sun and can be harvested after one hundred days. Melons are brightly colored and slightly larger than your average cantaloupe or honeydew melon. Melon flesh is pale green with a delicate flavor that enhances the flavor of any fruit salad.

Growing Instructions:
The Canary Melon is a warm-weather crop that thrives in full sun and should be planted after the final threat of frost of the season has passed. Seeds should be sown into soil that is consistently moist, but not overwatered, and they do best when some sort of compost has been added to the soil for nutrients. Sow the seeds an inch deep in the soil, and form small hills for each seed. Rows should be six feet apart with individual plants three feet apart. To keep the soil moist, it will require between 1-2"" of water each week. Avoid using insecticides so that the vines can receive pollination from bees. It is helpful to use a fence or trellis so that the vines can grow up, but if melons grow too large, they may need the support of the ground or extra support on the fence. Between 80 and 90 days, the melons are ready to be harvested. They should be easily picked off of the vine.

Description:
Pea microgreens are surprisingly healthy and easy to grow. With a little practice and effort, you’ll have your own supply of these delicious microgreens throughout the year! The term ‘microgreens’ means the growing of a plant into its first leaves appear. This can be achieved in the space of a few weeks. You’ll be surprised to discover that microgreens tend to have more nutrients than the mature plant. It is worth noting that if you leave the microgreens to grow longer you can actually get pea shoots instead. In effect, this is simply a case of waiting for the second set of leaves to grow; making the plant slightly taller but just as nutritious.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•USDA Zones: 3-12
•Spring sow in frost zones.
•Warmer climates can start in spring or as a fall or winter crop.

Description:
Red Burgundy onion seeds produce large flattened globes up to 4 inches in diameter that are beautiful for slicing. These onions are very mild with a sweet flavor and suitable for short term storage. This is a short day variety that matures in 95-165 days depending upon planting time, location and climate. Red Burgundy onions are resistant to Botrytis and Pink Rot.

Growing Instructions:
Since onions take a few months to mature from seed, gardeners with a short growing season may want to start their onion seeds indoors. Plant the seeds 1/2"" deep in a flat 2-3 months before the last frost date keeping the soil moist and at room temperature. When the tops begin to flop over, cut them off to 3"" to focus the growing on the roots. Four weeks before the last frost or when the soil reaches at least 50°, transplant the seedlings 6"" apart in rows 12"" apart. For direct sowing, sow 3 seeds per inch, 1/2"" deep in light, rich soil and full sun. Thin the seedlings to 2-6"" apart depending on the desired size. Thinned onions can be transplanted. Onions need moisture throughout their first weeks of growth and do not compete well with weeds. Mulching can help with both of these issues. In areas with warmer winters, these onions may be grown as a fall or winter crop.

Description:
The Tokyo Long White Bunching Onion – or Scallion – is an extremely tasty Japanese heirloom variety that grows well throughout the United States. Produces lovely white stalks with green leaves. Use Tokyo Long White Bunching Scallions in soups, stir-fries, and omelets. Slightly pungent, long white shanks with stiff blue-green tops. Resistant to hot weather and also fairly cold tolerant, but not recommended for over-wintering.

Growing Instructions:
For best results, onion seeds should be started indoors in flats and transplanted out of doors when seedlings are between 4-6 inches tall, taking care not to damage the roots. Onion seeds will germinate best in warm soil, between 68-75 degrees, with consistent moisture. Onion growers know that great onions come from well prepared soil. Onions need a sunny patch of fertile soil with good drainage. They prefer a pH of 6 to 7.5. When setting seedlings, actual root depth will depend on the length of root, but usually between 1.5 and 2 inches, making sure that most of the white of the stem is planted along with the root. Seedlings should be set at least 2-3 inches apart. Onions will thrive in moderate temperatures with consistent moisture. It is important to not let your onion plot dry out completely, this could stunt or even completely stop growth.

For an early spring crop, plant in the same manner in the fall. Peas do not do well when planted near onions or garlic. Before they bloom, pea plants need to be kept moist but not wet; after blooming, slightly increase the watering. Remove weeds carefully to avoid disturbing the plants; mulch may be helpful to conserve moisture and control weeds.

GROWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Sow Green Arrow pea seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, planting them 1 inch deep and 2-4 inches apart in rows 20-24 inches apart. They prefer full sun and well-draining, fertile soil. Water regularly, especially during flowering and pod development. Provide support for the vines with a trellis or stakes. Harvest when pods are full and tender but before they become too mature.",//southernseeds.com/cdn/shop/files/shopify-2023-07-19T154605.694_180x.png?v=1689799636 180w

•Organic
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Open Pollinated
•Days to Maturity: 7-14 Days

Description:
Pea shoots are the edible leaves of the traditional garden pea plant. The traditional pea plant takes the whole summer to grow in order to produce pea pods, but pea shoots are harvested within 2 weeks, creating super tender and flavorful roughage.


Nutritional Value:
This food is very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium. It is also a good source of Riboflavin, Vitamin B6, Pantothenic Acid, Magnesium, Phosphorus and Potassium, and a very good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Thiamin, Folate, Iron and Manganese.


Growing Instructions:
Grow in a greenhouse, indoors under lights, or outside when the weather is warm 65°F. Soak seeds for 8 hours (do not reuse water). Fill flats with 1–1½"" soilless media. Sow seeds close together and cover with an inverted tray using it to lightly press seeds into soil media. Leave the inverted tray on the flat for 2–3 days or until the germinating seeds lift the trays upwards an inch or so, then remove. Keep moist by misting on a regular basis or use a leak-proof tray to bottom water. If mold becomes a problem in warmer conditions the bottom watering method should be used. Shoots should be at a marketable size within 7–21 days. Grow in a dark area if a blanched final product is desired. As seedlings are growing, gently run a plant stake or your hand over the plants; this will help knock off the seed coats from the cotyledons. If some seed coats do not fall off readily, removal with fingers may be necessary. Some may not come off even with a gentle pulling; these plants should then be removed before harvest.

Description:
With so many different types of peas (shelling, snow, etc), it's hard to know what to grow. This heirloom variety is a shelling pea which means that you should allow it to reach maturity and then you'll ""shell"" the peas removing the pea shell and only use the peas inside. Green arrows are a vining pea variety, but only grows to 24-28"" making it an amazing choice for a home garden where space is often limited. Each pea 5"" pod will hold upwards of 11 peas each. It also is extremely easy to grow and will thrive in cold weather. Likewise, this is an excellent freezer variety allowing you to store them for future use. It's just a great all around pea.


Nutritional Value:
This food is very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium. It is also a good source of Riboflavin, Vitamin B6, Pantothenic Acid, Magnesium, Phosphorus and Potassium, and a very good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Thiamin, Folate, Iron and Manganese.


Growing Instructions:
Because peas thrive in cool weather and do not transplant well, Green Arrow garden pea seeds should be planted outside 4-6 weeks before the last frost or when the average soil temperature reaches at least 40 degrees F. If planting later, remember that most peas won't tolerate weather above 75 degrees F. If planting peas in your soil for the first time, keep in mind that a powder inoculant of beneficial bacteria should coat the seeds. Plant the peas 2"" apart and 2"" deep in light soil and full sun. For an early spring crop, plant in the same manner in the fall. Peas do not do well when planted near onions or garlic. Before they bloom, pea plants need to be kept moist but not wet; after blooming, slightly increase the watering. Remove weeds carefully to avoid disturbing the plants; mulch may be helpful to conserve moisture and control weeds.

•Scoville units: 50,000 - 100,000

Description:
This diminutive little pepper packs some registering in at 50,000-100,000 Scoville which is about 10x hotter than a jalapeño, yet far milder than the infamous habanero or Carolina reaper. Turns green/yellow to orange, purple, and red when ripe, but the immature green pepper are used just as much as the ripe ones. This pepper is great for drying whole or ground into a chili powder. In the culinary word, it is used in Asian, African, Spanish, Thai dishes as well as Portuguese peri-peri sauce.


Growing Instructions:
Start indoors in a sterile seed starting mix keeping the temperature above 70°. Once the plant has 6 to 8 true leaves and a well-established root system, harden off until the pepper plants can remain outside throughout the night. Some seeds can take 3 to 4 weeks to germinate. Transplant in large containers or raised beds. Water thoroughly—especially on the extremely hot days of summer. Make sure the plant receives lots of sun. Harvest cayenne peppers when they are red yet still firm. Use fresh in sauces or to add flavor to meats or vegetables. Thread the peppers on a string and hang to dry until they are brittle. Grind and store in a mason jar.

Sweet California Wonder Bell Pepper is one of the most popular large bell pepper plants around. The fruit is delicious for snacking, salads, sautéing or stuffing. These bell peppers pack plenty of crunch and vitamins, including vitamins C and A. The 4-inch fruit will be mature about 75 days after planting.


Growing Instructions:
To direct sow, plant seeds after the threat of frost. To get the earliest start to maximize the growing season, start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last average frost date in the spring. Start in a seed starting mix, planting 1/4"" deep and cover the container or tray with plastic to retain moisture then place in a warm, sunny spot. All peppers like heat, so keep the soil around 80° is preferred. Without adequate heat, germination can take significantly longer. A plant heating mat does wonders and is an amazing tool for any home gardener. Once seeds germinate and grow 2-3 true leaves, move them to a larger container filled with damp potting mix and keep consistently moist. Transplant to the garden a few weeks after the threat of frost and the soil temperature is around 65°. Make sure to harden the plants off by slowly exposing them to the elements over the course of a week to prevent stress. Likewise, remove any blossoms that may have formed before transplanting. This helps focus the energy of the plant to the primary structure and leads to a healthier transition. Leave 18"" between plants, water and mulch an inch or two. Mulching will help retain moisture and protect the roots. Ensure 1-2"" of moisture per week. In colder areas, laying plastic over the soil can help retain heat, but remove it once the soil temps get over 65°.

•Heirloom

•American grown seeds
•Scoville: 1 million
•USDA Zone: 8-11

Description:
The Red Ghost Pepper, also known as the Bhut Jolokia chilli, was formerly the hottest pepper on the planet. In 2007, the spicy Ghost Pepper chili won the title, which it maintained for four years. This is the world's hottest commercially cultivated pepper. These original heirloom seeds are the best.


Growing Instructions:
In order to best grow these peppers, your climate should most closely match that of their native India, which has five months of intensely high humidity and temperatures. At a minimum, they will need at least 3 months above 70°F. If your growing season is short, the ghost pepper plants can be moved indoors in the evening, however, these plants are sensitive to shifts in their environments and a lot of moving around may damage the plants irreparably. The surest way of growing ghost peppers is indoors or in a greenhouse where temperatures can be maintained. Using a plant heating mat, seeds for ghost peppers take around 35 days to germinate and 100-120 days to reach maturity in very warm soil between 80 and 90 degrees F and the soil must be kept moist consistently. A good rule of thumb is to wait for the top 2 inches of soil to dry before watering ghost pepper plants. Aim to maintain a regular watering schedule, as inconsistent watering can shock the plants. Before sowing, soak the seeds in hydrogen peroxide for a minute to increase germination success and use full sun fluorescent light bulbs to maintain temperature and humidity. Sow 1/4"" deep in full sun and loamy, slightly alkaline soil. To direct sow, start the seeds once night temps are above 70° with 18"" spacing between plants.

Description:
Among the hottest peppers anywhere, Habanero reaches up to 215,000 Scovilles of heat! These little peppers look harmless, but use them very sparingly, and remember to wear gloves when handling them to avoid transferring that heat to your eye! Blocky, wrinkled peppers measure about 1-2 inches long and slightly less wide, maturing from silvery-green to bright orange on the plant.

Growing Instructions:
Sow indoors at 75-80°F. A plant heating mat does wonders to help this. Peppers germinate and grow at a much slower rate at lower temperatures. Seeds can also be sown outdoors when the soil remains above 65°F in early summer. Indoors and out, sow at a depth of 4 times the size of the seeds and expect germination in 10-21 days and will generally fruit in 50-80 days after sowing. Transplant when there are at least two sets of true leaves. Plant out 2-3 weeks after the last frost. Space seedlings 18-24 inches apart in rows 30-36 inches apart.

Jalapeños rate 2,500–5,000 Scoville heat units (medium hot).

Growing Instructions:
They can be sown outdoors in early summer when the soil remains above 65 degrees F, but indoor germination is recommended. Indoors, start 6-8 weeks before planting date. Sow seeds into flat at a rate of 4 seeds/inch and then pot up into 2” or larger cells/pots after the first set of true leaves appear. For growing transplants, maintain temperature at around 75°F during the day and 65°F at night. Harden off plants by slightly reducing temperature to 60-65°F and reducing water for 2-3 days before transplanting. Peppers prefer light, well drained, moderately fertile soil with pH 6.5-6.8. Use a high phosphorus starter fertilizer when transplanting to give young peppers a good start. Keep nitrogen levels in moderation, as high amounts can reduce yields.

Fill your garden with a healthy snack for lunchtime and beyond. These sweet snacking peppers serve both loads of crunch and lots of beta-carotene and vitamin C. They’re ideal for eating straight off the plant, chopped fresh in salads, or sliced thin for stir-fries. Plants tend to give high yields, so consider staking with a tomato cage when planting in a windy location, to keep stems from breaking. Lunchbox Sweet Snacking Pepper plants work beautifully in containers; plant one per 18-inch pot. Underplant with dwarf marigolds for a pretty combination. Seeds will be approximately 2-3"" long with most being closer to 2” than 3"".

Planting Instructions:
All peppers need heat to germinate and some peppers can take as long as 30 days or more. The recommended easiest and fastest way to germinate is in a small pot with the seed barely covered with soil. Mist and cover with plastic wrap. Check every few days and never let dry out. Sitting on a heating mat for faster germination can potentially reduce time to 7-10 days. Cooler soil temps can result in very slow germination. Peppers can be grown all year long in containers.

Description:
This pepper is also known as the “Tuscan Pepper”, a reflection of its Italian origins. One of the best peppers for pickling! The mildly hot peppers can be picked when yellow, or allowed to mature to red. This is the pepper that is commonly served on authentic Italian antipasto platters that are the first course of Italian meals.


Growing Instructions:
Start pepper seeds indoors in peat pots about 8 weeks before the last expected spring frost. Sow them 1/4"" deep and keep the soil at 80-85°F until germination; provide sunlight or a grow light for 12-16 hours a day. When the outdoor temperature reaches 60-65° F during the day and no less than 50°F at night, transplant the seedlings 12-16"" apart. Exposing the plants to the weather for several hours a day before transplanting may help prevent shock. Peppers also grow well in containers or raised beds. Keep the soil evenly moist and weeds under control; mulching the plants may help with this. If excess heat and sun cause the plants to wilt, provide shade.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Easy to grow

Description:
One of the best varieties of purple peppers, Purple Beauty is highly productive and will produce crisp fruits with thick flesh. Delicious and beautiful, add color to your garden and dinner plate.

Growing Instructions:
Peppers, hot or sweet, can be quite easy to grow, but a little patience is required. Most varieties will take at least 85 days from sprouting to harvest. For best results, seeds should be started indoors approximately 8-10 weeks before the last expected frost date. Temperatures must be at least 70 degrees for good germination rates. When starting seeds, it is recommended to start three to a pot and thin the weakest seedling, leaving the remaining two to grow as one plant. Approximately one week before transplanting outdoors, harden off seedlings and prepare your plot with fertilizer or organic material, making sure your soil temperatures are at least 65 degrees consistently, or else seedlings will not survive the transplant. Seedling pairs should be placed about 18 to 24 inches apart. They need a well drained bed, but consistent moisture is also important -- plastic sheeting or mulch can be good ideas for retaining moisture, but a drip irrigation system can be a good approach as well. Peppers will appreciate a stake or cage for stability, especially when they begin to fruit. Put a few match heads and a teaspoon of fertilizer in the hole before planting, peppers like the sulfur.

Planting Instructions:
All peppers need heat to germinate and some peppers can take as long as 30 days or more. The recommended easiest and fastest way to germinate is in a small pot with the seed barely covered with soil. Mist and cover with plastic wrap. Check every few days and never let dry out. Sitting on a heating mat for faster germination can potentially reduce time to 7-10 days. Cooler soil temps can result in very slow germination. Peppers can be grown all year long in containers.

"Pepper, Red Hot Cherry (Capsicum annuum) - 25 Seeds","Red Hot Cherry Pepper (Capsicum annuum) - 25 Seeds

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Easy to Grow

Description:
Hot Cherry Peppers are great for container gardens. These hot peppers are rated between 3,000- 5,000 on the Scoville scale. As a pepper plant that produces continuously over a long season, hot cherry peppers are an heirloom variety and date back to the 1500s. Red Hot Cherry Peppers can be stored for about two weeks and then should be preserved. These peppers taste excellent pickled and are often found in specialty food stores as pickled cherry peppers.


Growing Instructions:
They can be sown outdoors in early summer when the soil remains above 65 degrees F, but indoor germination is recommended. Indoors, start 6-8 weeks before planting date. Sow seeds into flat at a rate of 4 seeds/inch and then pot up into 2” or larger cells/pots after the first set of true leaves appear. For growing transplants, maintain temperature at around 75°F during the day and 65°F at night. Harden off plants by slightly reducing temperature to 60-65°F and reducing water for 2-3 days before transplanting. Peppers prefer light, well drained, moderately fertile soil with pH 6.5-6.8. Use a high phosphorus starter fertilizer when transplanting to give young peppers a good start. Keep nitrogen levels in moderation, as high amounts can reduce yields.

"Pepper, Serrano (Capsicum annuum) - 25 Seeds","Serrano Pepper (Capsicum annuum) - 25 Seeds

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Easy to Grow

Description:
The serrano chili pepper is a quite a bit like the well known jalapeño pepper, similar in color, but smaller, about 1 to 4 inches long on average and 1/2 inch wide. They generally grow between 1 – 4 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide though they have been known to grow longer. They are meaty peppers and are not the best choice for drying, though it can be done. The serrano pepper originated in the Mexican states of Puebla and Hidalgo, in the mountainous regions. The name of the pepper, serrano, actually is a reference to the mountains (sierras) of those areas. They are commonly red, brown, orange, or yellow, though you are likely to find them in their more common green color, much like a jalapeno pepper. Serrano peppers are perfect for salsas, sauces, relishes, garnishes, making hot sauce and more. They are usually best when roasted. I personally love serrano peppers for their delicious spicy kick, either roasted, pan cooked, or fresh as a garnish. Where a jalapeno has a nice bite to it, the serrano steps it up a nice level, and has a fresh flavor similar to the jalapeno. Roasted serrano peppers are delicious and make a welcomed addition to many a meal. They’re perfect for making so many different spicy recipes, not only for the heat and flavor, but because they’re easy to grow. Serrano peppers rate 5,000-23,000 Scoville heat units.


Growing Instructions:
They can be sown outdoors in early summer when the soil remains above 65 degrees F, but indoor germination is recommended. Indoors, start 6-8 weeks before planting date.

Known as Sweet Potato Pumpkin as well as sweet potato squash, this mildly sweet, meaty squash is sometimes added to puddings, pies and cushaw butter. Striped, crook-necked, 10-20 pound fruits grow on heat-tolerant and borer-resistant vines. Several southwestern Indigenous nations, Louisiana, most of the southeast, and southern Appalachia have long cherished this variety, which was domesticated thousands of years ago in tropical Central America.

Growing Instructions:
Gardeners with short growing seasons may want to start the Small Sugar pumpkin seeds a month before the last expected frost. Since pumpkins do not take well to transplanting, peat pots are the best option. Plant two seeds per pot later clipping off the weaker seedling. Harden the seedlings off before transplanting about a week after the last frost or when soil temps reach at least 60°. Plant the seedlings in very rich soil, 8-10' apart in rows 10-12' apart. To direct sow, plant the seeds a week after the frost .5"" deep, 3-4' apart and thin to 8-10' apart. Since pumpkin seedlings do not tolerate frost, provide protection if cold weather threatens. Keep the soil moist at all times, but avoid getting the leaves wet. When the vines develop, a layer of mulch can help conserve water and reduce weeks which compete for resources. By midsummer, pinch off all the blooms to focus the plant's energy into the developing pumpkins.

"Radicchio, Palla Rossa - Italian Chicory (Cichorium intybus) - 100 Seeds","Palla Rossa Radicchio (Cichorium intybus) - 100 Seeds

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•USDA Zones: 4-10
•Sow spring or late summer

Description:
An early heading selection of this increasingly popular vegetable. Firm red heads with Beautiful red and green leaves and white veins. Can also be sown and left un-thinned for 'salad leaves' adding zest and a hint of bitterness to the mixed salad. Can be planted for both summer and fall harvest.

Growing Instructions:
Sow radicchio seeds directly into your garden starting in the early spring 2-3 weeks before the final frost of the season. Sow in late summer for a fall harvest. Radicchio grows best when the weather is chilly outside, so it’s an ideal spring and fall crop. Start indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date in the spring, and 8-10 weeks before the first frost date in the fall. Radicchio prefers to have a sunny location in your garden, but it can handle a bit of shade, especially in the fall. Spring planted radicchio should be planted in full sun to give it some warmth during the cooler weather. For your fall crop, pick a location that has a bit of afternoon shade to help the seeds germinate and not suffer in the heat. Mix organic matter into the soil before planting. The goal is to add some texture and nutrients to your soil. Organic matter helps to improve the moisture content in the earth. Due to their shallow roots, radicchio needs to have the ground consistently moist. Radicchio prefers a sandy, humus-rich loam with pH between 6.0-6.5.

Indoors, plant radicchio seeds in biodegradable containers and harden off for one week before planting in the garden. Transplant in the spring while temperatures are still cool but not freezing. Plant in the fall as temps start to cool down. Radicchio grows fabulous in containers so long as you use a seed-starting potting mix with the proper nutrients. Use a large pot that is at least 8-inches deep, and make sure to water the plants frequently.

•Winter crop, so harvest 2 months before first FALL frost

Watermelon radishes are an heirloom variety of daikon radishes and originated in China, where they are called shinrimei. They’re a root vegetable and member of the Brassica family, which also includes arugula, broccoli, and cabbage. The watermelon radish doesn’t actually taste like watermelon. Instead, the flesh, which is green around the exterior with a deep pink to bright red center, bears quite a resemblance to its namesake. Watermelon radishes are larger than regular radishes and can range from the size of a golf ball to that of a softball. They’re firm and crisp with a mild taste that’s a blend of slightly peppery and slightly sweet. These radishes are absolutely amazing in salads.

Nutritional Value:
Consuming watermelon radish is a great way to boost your intake of vitamins and minerals, as it is rich in phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, vitamin A and vitamin C. This colorful vegetable is also a good source of phytochemicals and antioxidants.

Growing Instructions:
Since watermelon radish seeds are winter radishes, they should be planted about two months before the first expected fall frost. Plant the daikon radish seeds in very rich, deeply worked up soil about 1/2"" deep and 1"" apart; later, thin the seedlings 4-6"" apart. Radishes do well with consistently moist soil and the addition of organic matter such as compost. Do not allow the soil to dry out, but also avoid overwatering as this can cause splitting.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•Open Pollinated
•American grown seeds
•90 Days
•USDA Zones: 3-9

Growing Instructions:
When to sow is highly dependent on your zone. If you are in a colder area, sow your rutabaga seeds after the danger of the last frost has passed. If you are in a warmer zone, plant your seeds in the fall and harvest in the winter. Those in the middle can sow in the summer for a fall crop. Leaves can be harvested and eaten when young, but roots take approximately 90 days to mature, and they become tastier and more tender after the first or second frost. Rutabaga should be planted in early to mid-summer depending on your zone, generally about three months before the first expected frost date. In warmer southern climates where the ground doesn’t freeze solid, it is also possible to plant before the last frost date in early spring for a first round. But keep in mind that hot weather can make roots taste bitter and woody.

Sow your seeds ½ inch deep and about 2-3 inches apart. Thin the rutabagas out when they are around 4 inches tall so there is between 4-6 inches of space between each plant.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Open Pollinated
•USDA Zones 5-12

Description:
The best vegetable you've never heard of! Dating back to the 1800s where it is native to Europeans who would cook Salsify in soups and stews. All parts of the plant are edible and deserves its place in every period or permaculture garden. Plant in the spring and dig up roots in the fall and into the winter. Cold hardy and reseeds, so dead-head to control spreading and either eat flowers or harvest seeds for next spring. Some say salsify has the subtle, sweet flavor of an oyster. Some say salsify has the flavor of asparagus or artichokes. Salsify is sometimes called “oyster plant”. Salsify can be cooked in many of the same ways as carrots, parsnips, and potatoes. It can be steamed, baked, boiled, sautéed, or braised. Salsify can come to harvest in early summer, but it is best during winter after it has been exposed to cold weather while still in the ground. Cold temperatures activate the conversion of starch into sugar and so salsify actually sweetens as the weather grows colder.

Growing Instructions:
This variety of salsify takes 4-5 months to mature and should be planted immediately after the last spring frost for a fall crop. After soaking the seeds overnight, direct sow in deeply worked soil 1/2"" deep and 1"" apart in rows 12-24"" apart. When the seedlings emerge, thin to 2-4"" apart. Thinned seedlings can be replanted elsewhere. Apply mulch to conserve moisture and prevent competing weeds which slow the growth of salsify. Harvest for fresh use when it reaches a mature length of 8"". Salsify does not store well in the refrigerator, but does exceptionally well in the ground and can be left in the ground until spring.

The minty, basil-like flavor has hints of clove and cumin.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Perennial in 10-11
•USDA Zones: 3-12

Growing Instructions:
Note from Ryan.... Shiso seeds degrade rather quickly as far as seeds go and should be stored in the freezer until they're ready to plant to prevent this. Being out the freezer during shipping is fine, but the more time in the cold, the better. Please be weary of sellers who are selling seeds from as far back as 2018. These seeds are from 2020 and we wouldn't think of selling Shiso seeds older than that. Sow in spring after the last frost.

Growing Instructions:
Note from Ryan.... Shiso seeds degrade rather quickly as far as seeds go and should be stored in the freezer until they're ready to plant to prevent this. Being out the freezer during shipping is fine, but the more time in the cold, the better. Please be weary of sellers who are selling seeds from as far back as 2018. These seeds are from 2020 and we wouldn't think of selling Shiso seeds older than that. Sow in spring after the last frost. The shiso seeds will germinate rapidly at 68 degrees or even a little cooler. Plant 1-2 seeds per inch, in rows 18"" apart. Sow seeds shallowly or cover lightly, as light is required for germination. Can grow somewhat thickly, or thin to 6-12"" apart.

"Sorrel, Red Veined (Rumex sanguineus) - 200 Seeds","Red Veined Sorrel (Rumex sanguineus) - 200 Seeds

•Also known as Bloody Dock or Bloodwort
•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Perennial
•USDA Zone: 3-7

Description:
Sorrel leaves have a tangy taste, with hints of citrus. They may be harvested as a baby leaf and used in salads, but can also be harvested when mature and cooked like spinach. Sorrel works well as an accompaniment to fish, meat and egg dishes, and as an ingredient in soup and gratins. Leaves may also be added raw to dishes. Red-veined sorrel, Rumex sanguineus, has pointed, bright lime-green leaves with dark red veins. Leaves are best harvested when young and used raw in salads. Sorrel is easy to grow, producing masses of pale green leaves. It’s a hardy perennial so can be treated as a cut-and-come-again crop, and leaves may even be harvested in mid-winter.


Planting Instructions:
Sow sorrel seeds indoors in early spring. Germination takes about 2 weeks. Transplant in mid to late spring. Space plants 12 to 15 inches apart and water generously. This herb grows best in full sun, but a partially shaded environment helps it deal with the heat. Not a beautiful plant and looking a bit weedy, cut back flower stalks to promote new growth. Sorrel does well in a container 6 to 12 inches deep and is ideal to grow as a cool-season annual as the young leaves have the best flavor. Harvest young leaves from established plants and use fresh for the best flavor. The tangy citrus flavor fades as older leaves become bitter, so harvest often to keep new growth coming. Well known for its use in soup, it is also great with fish and vegetables. With its strong yet agreeable flavor, it makes a great secret ingredient to add depth of flavor to salads.

"Soybean, Tohya (Glycine max) - 50 Seeds","Tohya Soybean (Glycine max) - 50 Seeds

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Open Pollinated
•Easy to grow

Description:
Tohya soybean seeds are our earliest maturing edamame option. They produce plump, slightly furry pods on stocky bush plants that grow to only 24” tall. The pods average three seeds each, maturing in a concentrated set for easy harvest. Tohya Edamame has great flavour and appealing texture for delicious homemade edamame. This variety still matures later in the season, but it is a bit earlier to mature than Sayamusume and Kuroshinju. Try some soybeans in your raised beds or in large patio containers. They are slow growing but very easy to grow and harvest.

Growing Instructions (USDA Zones 3-9):
After the last frost date plant 2"" apart, 1"" deep, rows 15–30"" apart in any good garden soil. In extremely rich soils, plants sometimes exhibit overly lush growth, growing too tall to stand up. In this case, plants should be hilled up with soil. Soybeans can stand somewhat dry conditions, but irrigation may be necessary during drought periods.
Most pods ripen at once. Clip plants near base when the beans are plump in the pods. Beans attain their highest fresh weight just as pods begin to lose their bright green color. Hand-strip remaining leaves. Shelling tips: strip pods, rinse, and steam or boil for about five minutes or until tender, after which the beans can be easily popped from the pods. Boil in salt water to complete cooking. Package for freezing at this point.

DRY SOYBEAN HARVEST: When at least 90% of the leaves have fallen and the pods are dry, pull the plants out by the roots. Complete drying under cover if the weather is wet.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Easy to grow
•Sow spring for early summer crops.
•Sow late summer/fall for fall and winter crops.

Description:
Bloomsdale Longstanding is a spinach that may very well become your favorite. The large leaves of this variety are thick, dark green and have a crinkled texture. Slow to bolt and only taking 45 days to mature, this is a great choice for late spring and summer planting.

Growing Instructions:
Because Bloomsdale spinach loves cool weather and can survive sub-zero temperatures when protected sufficiently, Bloomsdale spinach seeds should be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the spring or after the heat of summer for a fall crop. Gardeners in regions with warmer winters will be able to grow spinach all winter long. Sow the seeds in deeply worked soil 1/2"" deep and 2"" apart in rows 12-18"" apart, later thinning seedlings to 4-8"" apart. For continuous crops, plant more seeds every 10 days until the summer heat begins. Spinach seeds go dormant above 80-85°. Spinach also loves shade and can be planted under tall plants such as corn or pole beans.

Description:
Giant Noble spinach is a longstanding spinach variety that is a little sweeter than regular spinach and offers and extended harvest window. It grows up to 20"" tall in about 45 days and is quite bolt resistant. The leaves are smooth and suitable for fresh eating, freezing or canning.

Growing Instructions:
Because spinach loves cool weather and can survive sub-zero temps when protected sufficiently, it should be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in spring or after the heat of summer for a fall crop. Gardeners in regions with warmer winters will be able to grow spinach all winter long. Sow the seeds in deeply worked soil 1/2"" deep and 2"" apart in rows 12-8"" apart. Later thin the seedlings to 4-8"" apart. Thinned seedlings can be transplanted elsewhere for a larger crop. For continuous crop, plant seeds every 10 days until the summer heat begins. Spinach goes dormant over temps 80-85°. Spinach loves shade and can be planted under taller plants. If temps rise above 80°, provide some sort of shade. Begin harvesting the spinach leaves as soon as they grow big enough for eating.

"Spinach, Malabar Green (Basella rubra) - 100 Seeds","Green Malabar Spinach (Basella rubra) - 100 Seeds

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Easy to grow

Description:
Malabar spinach is actually not spinach at all. It’s not even related! Well, OK, it’s distantly related, but it doesn’t taste much like spinach at all. The Chinese name literally means flowing water vegetable. When it’s raw Malabar spinach has very fleshy, thick leaves that are juicy and crisp with tastes of citrus and pepper. When cooked, though, Malabar spinach does look and taste a lot more like regular spinach. It doesn’t wilt as fast, does much better in warmer climates, and it holds up better in soups and stir-fries.

Growing Instructions:
Scarify the seed with a file, sandpaper or even a knife to speed germination, which will take three weeks or longer at temperatures between 65-75 F. (18-24 C.). Malabar spinach does best in a slightly acidic, moist, fertile soil, though it can tolerate poor soil conditions. Sow indoors in flats 1/4"" deep and 1/4"" apart or in cells at 3 seeds per cell, 5-6 weeks before transplanting to the garden. After all danger of frost has passed, transplant out to the garden 6"" apart in rows 36"" apart. After all danger of frost has passed, sow directly into the soil 1-2"" apart, 1/4"" deep, in rows 36"" apart. Thin to 6"" apart. Stem tip cuttings may be rooted, overwintered inside, and transplanted out again the following year or kept as a houseplant. Provide trellis support for it to climb on. Pick young leaves and stems throughout the season. Pinching tips will encourage branching.

Soak the seeds overnight, then plant them 1/4"" deep and 10"" apart or in hills of three. Keep weeds under control until the plant is well established; water if the weather gets dry.

Growing Instructions:
Gardeners with short growing seasons may want to start their squash seeds indoors a month before the last expected frost. Since squashes do not take well to transplanting, peat pots are the best option. Plant 2 seeds per pot, later clipping off the weaker seedling. Harden the seedlings by exposing them to weather for several hours a day for a week before transplanting them after the last frost once soil temps average above 65°F. Plant in very rich soil, 8-10 inches apart in rows 10-12"" apart. To direct sow, plant the seeds a week or so after the last frost ½” deep, 3-4” apart and thin to 8-10” apart. Avoid planting them with potatoes. Keep moist, but avoid soaking the leaves as this can lead to rot or mildew. When vines develop, adding a layer of much can be very beneficial.

This variety produces blocky, dark green fruits that weigh from 3 to 5 pounds. The flesh is deep orange in color and fiberless. Dry and sweet, its taste is much like that of a sweet potato. This open pollinated squash matures in about 100 days. Winter squash such as Buttercup Burgess comes from the Native Americans, developed and cultivated in their gardens long before the arrival of the explorers and settlers. Traditionally, squash was grown alongside beans and corn as part of the “three sisters” group; these three vegetables greatly benefit each others’ growth. This variety of squash has a turban-like cap that is a good indicator of age: When the squash is mature and ready to be harvested, the cap is firm.

Growing Instructions:
Gardeners with short growing seasons may want to start their squash seeds indoors a month before the last expected frost. Since squashes do not take well to transplanting, peat pots are the best option. Plant 2 seeds per pot, later clipping off the weaker seedling. Harden the seedlings by exposing them to weather for several hours a day for a week before transplanting them after the last frost once soil temps average above 60°F. Plant in very rich soil, 8-10 inches apart.

To direct sow, plant the seeds a week or so after the last frost ½” deep, 3-4” apart and thin to 8-10” apart. Avoid planting them with potatoes. Keep moist, but avoid soaking the leaves as this can lead to rot or mildew. When vines develop, adding a layer of much can be very beneficial. By midsummer, pinch off all the blooms to concentrate the plant’s energy on the developing squashes. Seedlings don’t tolerate frost well, so provide protective covering if cold weather threatens.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO

•USDA Zones 3-12

Description:
The plant grows quickly and matures easily. Known as Crookneck, this summer squash bears many 6-inch lemon-yellow fruit that is shaped like a crook. A plant's growth rate is rapid and prolific. This summer, harvest as much as you can. Steam it with nutmeg, or fry it softly with parmesan cheese and bacon crumbles. When the skins are soft, harvest them. Pick plants frequently so they will continue to produce.


Medicinal Properties:
On top of all those awesome vitamins and minerals, squash also delivers über-healthy compounds called carotenoids—specifically lutein and zeaxanthin. It's those compounds that (per the research) seem to give squash additional, amazing health boons. Just like those carotenoids build up in the skin of the squash, they build up in our skin, too, when we eat carotenoid-rich produce regularly. That buildup shields our skin from UV rays and pollution—according to scientific studies—and also may slow skin aging by helping to keep skin hydrated and elastic.

"Squash, Delicata (Cucurbita Pepo) - 20 Seeds","The old folks call it Sweet Potato Squash for its rich, sugary, tender flavor, and you will see what they mean with the very first bite! Delicata is the absolute best winter squash for long-term storage, but despite being a winter squash, they grow during the peak of summer and are harvested in the fall.

Weighing in at 1 to 1½ pounds each, these lozenge-shaped loaves are white to cream, with grooves and dark green stripes and flecks. Inside, the flesh is golden-orange, with a central seed cavity. To cook delicata, simply slice the fruit lengthwise and steam or bake it right in its ""shell""; it also works well on the grill, because the rind is tough enough to hold together and impart a smoky flavor. The flesh can also be scooped out and pureed or chopped before cooking, of course. It has a nutty, sweet flavor. And you can even roast the seeds like pumpkin seeds!

These delicata squash reach about 7 to 9 inches long and up to 4 inches in diameter, and they arise quite freely on vigorous vines. Delicata has a fabulous storage ability, bringing you great eating all winter!

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Sow 2-3 weeks before last spring frost to 2 months before first fall frost.

Description:
'Fordhook Giant' is an old favorite with its broad, strong stems and large leaves packed with vitamins and minerals. A vigorous grower with a long growing season, it will provide fresh greens from early summer into fall, and year-round in mild climates. White stem varieties are generally more bolt and cold tolerant and more productive than colored stem varieties. Young leaves are great for salads. Glows in containers as an ornamental.

Growing Instructions:
Start outdoors as early as 2 to 4 weeks before your average last frost date when soil temperature is at least 40°F. Ideal soil temps are 75°–90°F. Sow as late as 2 months before first fall frost. In mild climates, you can sow in the fall. Sow 2-3 seeds in a group every 6-8"" half an inch deep in a soil with an ideal pH level between 6 and 6.4. When seedlings reach 1/2"" tall thin to 1 plant every 8"". Keep 18"" between rows to allow enough room for growth. Indoors start, sow 4 to 6 weeks before transplanting out, as early as 2 to 4 weeks before your average last frost date. The Fordhook Giant will do best with full or partial sun and will need to be watered evenly. Pick up to 1/3 of the outer leaves as needed, and let more leaves grow from the center of the plant; or, if desired, harvest the whole plant 2"" above ground, and it will grow back. Pick very young leaves, at 2""-4"" for using fresh in salads.

"Three Sisters Seed Collection - Native American Farming - Corn, Bean, Squash","Three Sisters Seed Collection

The crops of corn, beans, and squash are known as the Three Sisters. For centuries these three crops have been the center of Native American agriculture and culinary traditions. It is for good reason as these three crops complement each other in the garden as well as nutritionally.

Corn provides tall stalks for the beans to climb so that they are not out-competed by sprawling squash vines. Beans provide nitrogen to fertilize the soil while also stabilizing the tall corn during heavy winds. Beans are nitrogen-fixers meaning they host rhizobia on their roots that can take nitrogen, a much needed plant nutrient, from the air and convert it into forms that can be absorbed by plant roots. The large leaves of squash plants shade the ground which helps retain soil moisture and prevent weeds.

These three crops are also at the center of culinary traditions and complement one another as well. A diet of corn, beans, and squash is complete and balanced. Corn provides carbohydrates and the dried beans are rich in protein and have amino acids absent from corn. Squash provides different vitamins and minerals than corn and beans. These three crops are also important because they can all be dried and used for food year round.

INCLUDED SEEDS

•60 Corn, Bodacious
•50 Bean, Blue Lake
•25 Squash, Zucchini Dark Green


Planting Instructions:
See 2nd photo for layout.

Mound the soil approximately 4 inches high with a small well in the center. It should resemble a moon crater. Plant 4 corn seeds in the center in the well, 6 inches apart and 1-3 inches deep. After corn is about 4 inches tall, plant 4 beans seeds halfway down the sides of the mound at least 3 inches from the corn plant, 1 inch deep. After the beans have emerged, plant 2 squash seeds 24 inches from the center of the mound on opposite sides. Train squash to vine outward from the mound and not crowd the corn and beans. Place additional mounds 3-4 feet apart from the center.",//southernseeds.com/cdn/shop/files/SHOPIFYCOLLECTIONTEMPLATE_13_180x.png?v=1689809835 180w

This is a vigorous tomato that produces thick-walled globe shaped tomatoes and one of the few low acid red varieties. We highly recommend this tomato for anyone that wants and amazing tasting, easy to grow tomato.


Growing Instructions:
Start Ace 55 heirloom tomato seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost of spring, sowing the seeds in a flat 1/4"" deep and 1"" apart. Keep the temperature at 70-75°F until germination, as well as providing adequate light in a sunny window or under a grow light; keep the soil moist, but make sure drainage is adequate. When the second set of leaves emerges, transplant the seedlings into individual pots; bury the stems up to the lowest set of leaves to grow strongly rooted plants. A week before planting the seedlings outside, begin exposing them to the weather during the day to harden them; tomatoes cannot endure cold weather, and should not be transplanted outside until all threat of frost has passed. When the soil temperature reaches at least 70°F, plant the seedlings in full sun and very rich soil; once more, bury the entire stem up to the lowest set of leaves. Space the plants 2' apart. For companion planting benefits, plant Ace 55 heirloom tomato seeds with carrots or onions, but avoid planting them with cabbage or tomatoes. Since temperatures below 55°F can damage production, protect the plants if temperatures drop. A thick layer of mulch helps conserve moisture and control weeds; water the plants once a week, but avoid getting the leaves wet.

Plant Roma VF Tomato Seeds in a sunny spot and enjoy a heavy-bearing harvest.

Growing Instructions:
Choose a commercially prepared seed starting mix. Make sure that your mix does not have a high fertilizer content; this can actually be a detriment to your tomatoes. Prepare your seed starting mix by combining it with warm water to make it arable. You might find that your mix can be difficult to wet, especially if it was a completely dry mix. Some gardeners let their mixes sit overnight to ensure that the water is evenly distributed. The final consistency should be damp and sponge-like. It should not feel soggy or water-logged. Germinate your tomato seeds in the container of your choosing. Tomato seeds will germinate in any container as long as excess water can drain, and they are given enough moisture and warmth. Many nurseries and home gardeners use growing “flats” with different sized plastic cell inserts. Fill your container with moist seed starting mix and plant the seeds 1/8th inch (3mm) deep. At this stage, it is okay to plant many seeds close together as seedlings will later be transplanted. If you are using a used container, it is best to sterilize them with a 10% bleach solution. Place germination containers out of direct sunlight in a warm location. Although light is not needed in the germination process, it is not harmful as long as high temperatures are avoided. It only takes 5 to 10 days for tomato seeds to germinate if they are kept in their optimum temperature range for 70 to 80F (21 to 27C). Lower temperatures delay germination and higher temperatures accelerate it. Extreme temperatures, below 50F (10C) or above 95F (35C) are damaging to germination.

**Recommended tip: Cover the germination containers with a plastic bag or sheet of plastic. This will help preserve moisture, but you must ensure that air can circulate and the mix does not dry out.

A cool weather crop, turnips thrive when planted three weeks before the last frost in the spring, or after the hottest part of summer for a fall crop.

Growing Instructions:
A cool weather crop, turnips thrive when planted three weeks before the last frost in the spring, or after the hottest part of summer for a fall crop. Direct sow the seeds in rich, deeply worked soil and full sun, 1/2|” deep in rows 12-18” apart. As the seedlings grow, thin them to 4-6” apart. Harvest greens as soon as they reach a good size for eating. If using both the greens and the root, harvest only 2-3 leaves per root. Since small turnips have the most tenderness and flavor, pull them when they reach 1-3 inches.
