Amaranth 'Midnight Red' is a stunning heirloom variety known for its dramatic, deep maroon foliage that adds a touch of gothic elegance to any garden.

Because it is a biennial, the first year Burdock only forms a cluster of large leaves. The large leaves grow from a carrot-like root that can penetrate over two feet into the ground. It is this Burdock root that is most often used in herbal medicine. After a year of growth, Burdock puts forth a branched stalk with smaller leaves and, in the late summer, purple-pink flowers. In autumn, these flowers are replaced by round brown burrs that persist into the winter. The herb seeds contained in these burrs are also used medicinally.

Planting Instructions:
Caper seeds are very tiny and dormant. Dried seeds are more difficult to germinate, so soak for one day in warm water and then cold stratify in the refrigerator for 2-3 months. After the cold cycle, re-soak the seed overnight before sowing at a depth of .5"" in a very well draining medium. For northern growers, it's often best to start them in a large pot with a base of coarse rock or crumbled brick. Take care not to overwater as this plant's foliage is a natural water conservator. They will need sunlight to flourish and temps of -20°F or lower will kill them, so bring the pot indoors or put in a greenhouse. When transplanting, be sure to not disturb the roots as little as possible. Before moving plant outside, be sure to ""harden off"" for a week to allow the plant to adjust to the new environment.

Caraway (Carum carvi) - 150 Seeds,"Caraway, Carum carvi, is a member of the Apiaceae, or Umbelliferae family that includes celery, carrot, parsnips, fennel, parsley, and other fragrant flowering plants. It is a biennial herb best known for aromatic fruit that is called a seed, and used as a spice. Its flavor is distinctly pungent, with anise and licorice undertones, and has become synonymous with classic rye bread. And while its fruit is the main attraction, the similarly fragrant leaves as well as the roots are also edible. In the first year, it produces roots and foliage, and dies to the ground at season’s end. In the second, the foliage becomes bushy, tops out at two feet or more, and produces an “umbel” (think umbrella) arrangement of tiny pink or white florets that make up a flat-topped flower head. At season’s end, the florets wither, giving way to the fruit we refer to as seed.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Biennial
•USDA Zones 4-10

Growing Instructions:
Sow shallowly, ¼"" deep, about 1 seed per inch in rows 18"" apart, in either early spring or fall; both plantings will bloom and produce seed in the second year. Thin to 4–8"" apart. Cultivate well when young, as caraway does not compete well with weeds. Be especially careful to prevent injury to roots. Prefers full to partial sun and a rich, well-drained, sandy loam, but grows well in a variety of soils, including clay. Soil pH of 6–7.5.Harvest by pulling or cutting the plants as soon as the fruits begin to ripen to minimize shattering, which causes caraway to self-sow. Place harvested plants on a ground cloth or in a paper bag to avoid seed loss. Thresh and winnow to remove and clean the seeds. Dry to 10% moisture content, at temperatures no higher than 100°F/38°C.

The small, star-shaped flowers are usually cream colored and born on sturdy stems in June. The flowers can be eaten or dried and made into floral arrangements. The seed heads are also often used in everlasting arrangements or can be allowed to remain and drop seeds for continual reseeding.

Growing Instructions:
Garlic chives grow well in a variety of soil types though they prefer moist, well drained soil and full sun to partial shade. In short growing seasons, they can be started indoors in flats. Provide bottom heat for fastest germination. To direct sow, plant the seeds after the last frost in 1/4"" deep in rows 18"" apart. Thin to 6-8"" as soon as the seedlings appear. Germination should occur in 14 days. Garlic chives also grow well as container plants. Keep the soil moist as the seedlings are developing. Garlic chives will spread vigorously with each year of growth and can easily be divided for new plants. To plant the seed from reseeding itself, be sure to remove the developing heads and keep the plant trimmed. The first year, garlic chives should not be harvest to ensure their strong development. The second year, harvest chives at any time after they reach a length of 6"", cutting them 1/2"" above the soil with scissors. Frequent cutting improves production.

This shrub has been used for centuries to make teas, syrups and medicinal tinctures, and was even named Herb of the Year in 2013 by the International Herb Association. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just getting started, elderberry is a great choice for your next herb project.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Perennial
•USDA Zones: 3-9

Planting Instructions:
By far the easiest method is to direct sow outdoors in the fall and let Mother Nature do it's thing over the winter to break the dormancy. Sow at 1/4"" depth, 10 feet apart, and 3-4 seeds per plant. Keep moist, but not wet.

INDOORS: Starting inside, elderberry is a long term, multiple stage process that needs BOTH scarification (soaking) and stratification (warm/cold treatment) to break the dormancy. Basically, we're trying to replicate what occurs naturally in nature ( berries fall, rot, seeds warm over late summer and fall, go through the winter to break dormancy, and then germinate in the spring). It's a long process, but one that we find is extremely rewarding. Elderberry is finicky and it’s such a gratifying feeling when you first see seedlings pop up.

STAGE 1 - SCARIFICATION
The slower, but safer and easier method is to soak the seeds in HOT (175F) water for 10 minutes, allow to cool and continue to soak at room temperature for 24 hours. The fastest method is to soak the seeds in sulfuric acid for 10 mins and then thoroughly rinse. The seeds are then ready for Stage 2.

STAGE 2 - WARM STRATIFICATION
After the soaking (scarification), the seeds will need to go through a warm period. In a plastic container or zip lock bag, fill it partially with peat moss. Next, put a layer of paper towel down on top of the peat moss and dampen it. Now, lay the seeds on top of that paper towel. Then add another layer of paper towel on top and dampen it. You're basically making a seed sandwich....

"Elderberry, European Black (Sambucus nigra) - 50 Seeds","The European Elder (Sambucus nigra) is a deciduous shrub that grows between 20-30 feet tall and can be pruned and trained into a tree form. It prefers a cool climate and is common in hedgerows in Ireland and England, and is cultivated for commercial use throughout Europe. The American Elderberry (Sambucus nigra L. ssp. canadensis), also a deciduous shrub, rarely exceeds 13 feet in height and is more shrub-like. Both varieties produce the deep purple/black berries (hence the name), used in wines, extracts, syrups and in pies, jams and other foods.

Which elderberry to choose?

If you're looking for an elderberry that is more like a tree and you're in a cooler climate, the European Elder is a great fit. If you want an elderberry that's a bushier shrub or live in a warmer climate, the American elderberry is the better fit.

•USDA Zones: 6-8

Planting Instructions:
By far the easiest method is to direct sow outdoors in the fall and let Mother Nature do it's thing over the winter to break the dormancy. Sow at 1/4"" depth, 10 feet apart, and 3-4 seeds per plant. Keep moist, but not wet.

INDOORS: Starting inside, elderberry is a long term, multiple stage process that needs BOTH scarification (soaking) and stratification (warm/cold treatment) to break the dormancy. Basically, we're trying to replicate what occurs naturally in nature ( berries fall, rot, seeds warm over late summer and fall, go through the winter to break dormancy, and then germinate in the spring). It's a long process, but one that we find is extremely rewarding. Elderberry is finicky and it’s such a gratifying feeling when you first see seedlings pop up.

STAGE 1 - SCARIFICATION
The slower, but safer and easier method is to soak the seeds in HOT (175F) water for 10 minutes, allow to cool and continue to soak at room temperature for 24 hours. The fastest method is to soak the seeds in sulfuric acid for 10 mins and then thoroughly rinse. The seeds are then ready for Stage 2.

STAGE 2 - WARM STRATIFICATION
After the soaking (scarification), the seeds will need to go through a warm period. In a plastic container or zip lock bag, fill it partially with peat moss. Next, put a layer of paper towel down on top of the peat moss and dampen it. Now, lay the seeds on top of that paper towel. Then add another layer of paper towel on top and dampen it. You're basically making a seed sandwich....

"Elderberry, Pacific Red (Sambucus callicarpa) - 50 Seeds","This West Coast red elderberry variety was described under the name S. callicarpa however there is little difference between the European and Pacific Coast plants outside their native habitat. Recently, both varieties of red elderberry have grouped together under the name Sambucus racemosa (Sambucus racemosa var. racemosa). Most elderberry species are native to the northern hemisphere, but no matter where they grow, they’ve been used in cooking, in the making of dye or ink, and as medicine. According to folklore, elder is said to ward off and cure disease and offer protection from lightning, saddle sores and all forms of evil.

Description:
This stunning plant features handsome, yellow flowers and is named after Helen of Troy. As the legend goes, she was holding an elecampane in her hand when she left to live with Paris in Troy, another legend says that it sprung up from where her tears fell. It was used in ancient Rome for culinary purposes as well as medication. Elecampane is native to Europe and parts of Asia, but it is cultivated all over the world.

Planting Instructions:
Elecampane prefers part shade and moist soils, although full sun will be tolerated. Sow seeds in a greenhouse in early spring or sow directly in the garden in mid-spring. This is a light-dependent germinator (plant on surface or only very shallowly covered, so light can penetrate). Expect germination in about 12 days. After the second set of leaves appear, transplant seedlings out to the garden, even if you still expect a few frosts. Grows in full sun or partial shade. Plant 2 feet apart.

Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides) - 25 Seeds,"Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides) - 25 Seeds
•Bee Friendly
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds

Description:
Epazote (pronounced eh-pah-ZOH-teh) is an aromatic herb; both the fresh leaves and tender stems are used in cooking. The epazote plant is a leafy annual or short-lived perennial plant that can reach 4 feet in height. Its dark green, long, slender, jagged leaves end in a point. The flowers are green and very small; they produce thousands of tiny seeds. As an herb, it is suitable for gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, and paleo diets. Native to Central America, epazote has been grown for culinary and medicinal purposes for countless generations. This herb is used in everyday cooking in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca and the Yucatan Peninsula among the Mayan-speaking peoples. Epazote has spread as a weed (growing in empty lots and by roadsides) throughout a large part of North and South America and even into Europe and Asia.

Planting Instructions:
SOWING: Direct seed (recommended): Sow outdoors shallowly, as seeds require light to germinate, 2-3 seeds per inch, once the soil has warmed in early spring. Thin to stand 4-6"" apart in rows, or clumps every 6-12"", in rows that are 12-18"" apart. Transplant: Press seeds lightly, as seeds require light to germinate, into a soil mix that has been premoistened. Water in with the same mixture. Transplant to larger cells when seedlings develop true leaves and later to outside when they are about 3-4"" tall. Space plants 4-6"" apart in rows that are 12-18"" apart.

LIGHT PREFERENCE: Sun.
SOIL REQUIREMENTS: Grow in average to poor soil. When grown in an acidic soil, the ""purpling,"" which is usually barely visible in the stems and leaf veins, can become more prominent.
PLANT HEIGHT: 24-36"".
PLANT SPACING: 4-6"".
HARDINESS ZONES: Annual.
HARVEST: Harvest leaves or whole young plants for fresh use. Harvest black seeds when ripe and dry for medicinal use.
Note: Epazote self-sows readily. May become invasive, if allowed to do so.

Planting Instructions:
SEEDS ARE VERY SMALL. They are more successfully germinated if direct sown outdoors in the fall, but moderately easy to germinate in flats. As they need cold to germinate, it’s best to use a stratification technique. This sounds complicated, but it's really easy. A 30-day period of cold, moist refrigeration will speed germination appreciably.

Select an area with full to partial sunlight. Ideal locations include areas near drainage ditches or near bodies of water in full sunlight. These areas will be high in humidity, which is ideal for fireweed. Make sure the soil is moist to slightly soggy. Pull up any weeds in the area before planting the seeds. Use a small tiller or shovel to mix the soil and fertilizer about 5 inches in depth. Smooth out the top of the soil without packing it down firmly. Spread the fireweed seeds over the soil. You can place the seeds about 3 feet apart, as the plants will grow fast and fill in the bare spots. The optimum time to plant fireweed seeds is during the fall season. Cover the seeds with 1/2 inch of soil. Water the seeds after planting, then only water when the soil feels dry or when drought occurs. After the plant is established, little to no water is needed.

Description:
Job's tears (Coix lacryma-jobi) is a grasslike plant renowned for its hard, edible seeds that mature to a uniform black and can be used to make rosaries, necklaces and other pieces of jewelry. Originally native to southeast Asia and Polynesia, the plant grows wild today in parts of Europe and Central America. Job's tears can be useful in a home garden for its attractive foliage and also as a source of seeds.

Job's tears is a tropical perennial suitable for culture year-round in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 9 through 11. In colder areas, it can be grown as an annual or indoors in a greenhouse or a warm, sunny room. The plant is about 3 feet tall and has erect stems with grassy leaves that appear individually along each stem. In warm areas where it is a perennial, its leaves appear in the early spring. Its flowers, which are tiny, green and inconspicuous, develop from July into October, hanging down in long clusters from each stem. Eventually, yellow tassels develop on the flower clusters, followed by seeds that start out green, turn gray and then become shiny and evenly black when ripe, later in the fall.

Culinary Uses:
Seeds of Job’s Tears are a delicious nutritious Ancient Asian grain that is going to bypass rice and quinoa as the new gluten-free SUPER grain.

Lavender seeds are best started indoors, 6 to 8 weeks prior to the last frost after a 3 week cold stratification. Start in peat pots, sowing 3 to 5 seeds per pot, at a shallow depth of 1/16” under topsoil. The seeds will require a bit of direct light to properly germinate, so try not to bury them deeper than the recommended depth. Transplant small pots into larger containers if necessary, or transplant directly into the garden, when the weather is warm and all danger of frost has passed. Lavender herbs will require an area of full sunlight for the majority of the day. Temperatures of at least 70F are recommended. A light soil that contains a small amount of gravel will best suit your Lavender plants, as they will need a well draining medium. They are fond of slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soils, with a pH of 6.5 to 8.0. Water the seeds daily with a spray bottle or mist setting, until germination has successfully occurred. Lavender seeds will typically germinate within 7 to 21 days after sowing. This strain will produce 30 inch plants, forming a compact, bush like growth habit. The plants can be spaced about 12 to 18 inches apart from one another.

For best results, water lightly with a spray bottle or something similar. Transplant outdoors as soon as the seedlings grow big enough to handle, or after the last spring frost. To direct sow after the last frost, plant the seeds on the surface of the soil and keep it evenly moist until germination, which should take place within 2-3 weeks.

He gestured toward what looked like design elements of bolting lettuce.

Before planting, pour 180 degrees F water over the seed and let it soak overnight. In late fall or early spring, direct sow the treated seed 1/4"" deep. To start the seed indoors, sow seeds in a flat or individual peat pots 6-8 weeks before the last frost; keep the soil lightly moist and at a temperature of 70 degrees F until germination, which usually occurs within two weeks. When the weather has warmed and the seedlings are well established, transplant outdoors. Keep the soil moist as the seedlings develop. This plant prefers moist, sandy soil. It grows rather slowly at first because of its extensive root system, which takes much of its energy in the first stages of growth.

Description:
Grow this unusual but very attractive little gem from Nigella seeds. This Love In A Mist seed mix produces blooms in shades of red, white and blue which reach up to 2 1/2 inches across. Once the flowers are done, equally attractive seed pods form once the blooms dry. The Love In A Mist plant foliage is lacy and fern-like giving the plant an airy effect. The flower is great to use as a cut flower, and the seed pods are great to use in arrangements once dried. To dry Nigella flowers and seed pods: Cut the stem and hang upside down in a cool location.

Planting Instructions:
Sow Nigella Love in a Mist seeds outdoors in early spring. The flower seed can be lightly covered with soil. Each plant has a short bloom season, so it is best to have successive plantings every three weeks to have blooms all season. Thin the seedlings to 6 inches between plants, and the plants should start blooming in three months. Deadheading will prolong flowering, but will eliminate the attractive seed pods that form later.

Maca (lepidium meyenii) - 25 Seeds,"Maca (lepidium meyenii) -25 Seeds

•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds

Description:
Also known as Peruvian Ginseng or Pepperweed, Lepidium Meyenii is an herb native to the high Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The leaves of this plant form rosettes atop a taproot that resembles a turnip albeit smaller reaching two to three inches in diameter. This species has been used for centuries dating back to Incan warriors who took the herb before battle. Also known as Maca, this highly nutritious plant is said to improve strength and endurance. It is also distributed around the world as an aphrodisiac. In addition to these benefits, maca is widely used as an edible in its native region for both humans and livestock.

Growing Instructions:
Keep seeds dry and cool. At 60F, maca seeds will retain germination above 80% for two years, falling to about 50% in years 3 and 4, and then dropping off fairly dramatically thereafter. Cooler storage conditions would probably extend life. Maca can be grown from seed unproblematically. The plant is considered to be extremely robust, because in nature it is exposed to the extreme climatic conditions of the Andes (temperature variations, strong winds and intense UV radiation). In the wild, it grows best when its seeds germinate before the rainy season. Maca seeds should be pressed about half a centimeter deep into the soil and watered immediately. After the sowing and during the entire growth phase the substrate should be kept cool and moist.

"Marjoram, Sweet (Origanum majorana) - 100 Seeds","Marjoram (Origanum majorana) - 100 Seeds

•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Bee Friendly
•Butterfly Friendly

Description:
One of the most popular culinary herbs, marjoram’s delicate, citrusy flavor makes it especially versatile. Marjoram is an aromatic herb in the mint (Lamiaceae) family that has been cultivated for thousands of years. In Greek mythology, marjoram was grown by the goddess Aphrodite. The fuzzy, green, oval-shape leaves grow opposite from each other, forming distinctive clusters, or knots (it’s also known as knotted marjoram). Native to the Mediterranean, North Africa, and western Asia, marjoram is often called sweet marjoram to distinguish it from oregano varieties like wild marjoram (Origanum vulgare) and pot marjoram (Origanum onites), aka Turkish oregano. The primary flavor compounds in marjoram are sabinene (fresh, woody), terpinene (citrusy), and linalool (floral). Marjoram has a milder flavor than oregano and tastes similar to thyme, but sweeter and with a stronger scent. It’s warm, slightly sharp, and a little bitter.

Culinary Uses:
Marjoram can be wrapped in cheesecloth with other herbs to create an aromatic sachet for braises and stews, or sprinkled fresh onto vegetable side dishes. Dried marjoram is a popular addition to salad dressings, meat dishes, and preserved meats such as German sausage. Used in both fresh and dried form, marjoram is subtler than its relative oregano and well suited to delicate vegetables, tomato-based dishes, such as tomato sauce and pizza, and poultry seasoning. Marjoram is an important component of spice blends.

Medicinal Uses:
It is also used as a “nerve tonic” and a “heart tonic,” and to promote better blood circulation. Marjoram oil is used for coughs, gall bladder complaints, stomach cramps and digestive disorders, dizziness, migraines, nervous headaches, nerve pain, paralysis, coughs, runny nose; and as a “water pill.”

Growing Instructions:
In short growing seasons, start marjoram inside about a month before the last frost. Sow the seeds just below the surface of the soil and keep evenly moist at 65-75°. Germination can take up to 3-4 weeks. Transplant well after the last frost since marjoram cannot tolerate cold. Place the seedlings 10-12"" apart in light, well drained soil and full sun. Marjoram can also be direct sown after the last frost planting the seeds 6-8"" apart and thinning the seedlings to 10-12"". Marjoram also grows exceptionally well as a container plant or house plant. Marjoram is extremely easy to care for preferring slightly dry soil and strong sunlight. Harvest the leaves and sprigs when plant reaches 6"" tall.

•Hummingbird Friendly
•USDA Zone: 3-9

Description:
It is easy to grow from Marsh Mallow seeds, and it also makes a lovely flowering display as well as having therapeutic benefits. It is a branching plant that reaches 36 to 48 inches in height. The stems are slightly wooly and the leaves are soft and downy. The flowers reach 2 inches across, have 5 petals and range in color from white to reddish-white. Hummingbirds enjoy their sweet nectar.

The Marshmallow root is yellow-white and sweet. It is similar in taste to a parsnip. The roots can be harvested in the fall for drying. The history of our modern day sugary marshmallow goes back to this herb plant. The gummy substance, mucilage, was actually the thickening ingredient in a dessert made from egg whites.

Planting Instructions:
Direct sow in late fall planting 5-6 seeds per plant just below the surface soil spaced 18-24"" apart. For spring planting, mix the seeds with moist sand and store it in the refrigerator for 60 days before direct sowing. To start indoors, sow seeds in flats or individual peat pots keeping the soil lightly moist and at a temperature of 80-85° until germination. Keep the seedlings evenly moist and transplant outdoors when the weather warms.

Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) - 50 Seeds,"Meadowsweet, is known by many other names. In Chaucer's The Knight's Tale it is known as meadwort and was one of the ingredients in a drink called ""save"". It was also known as bridewort, because it was strewn in churches for festivals and weddings, and often made into bridal garlands. In Europe, it took its name ""queen of the meadow"" for the way it can dominate a low-lying, damp meadow. It can be found throughout most of Europe and Western Asia. The plant contains concentrations of salicylic acid, the chemical used to make aspirin and is used in magick for love, peace, and happiness. Meadowsweet blooms from early Summer to early Autumn, with delicate densely-packed clusters of tiny creamy-white flowers.

*The Latin name Spiraea ulmaria is synonymous with the Latin name Filipendula ulmaria.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Perennial
•USDA Zones: 3-8

Planting Instructions:
Meadowsweet seeds require light to germinate, so they perform best when surface sown. Scatter two or three seeds across the surface of the medium with approximately 1 inch of space between them. The seeds must be lightly pressed onto the surface so they are firmly anchored to the soil. A thin layer of medium-grade perlite spread over the soil surface allows light to reach the seeds while still holding moisture around them. Mist the perlite with water so it settles onto the seeds. The germination process is fairly straightforward for meadowsweet seeds, although it is somewhat slow. In temperate climates where frosts are rare, the pots can be kept outdoors in a bright, sheltered location from sowing time until the seeds sprout in spring. The most important factor apart from light exposure is moisture because the seeds may die or germinate poorly if kept too wet or too dry. Probe the medium with your fingertip every day to gauge the moisture level. Using a spray bottle, moisten the top 2 inches of the medium. Don't let the medium dry out completely on the surface, but avoid making it sopping wet. Viable, healthy meadowsweet seeds germinate within three months in spring when daytime temperatures top 70 degrees. Meadowsweet plants form dense, spreading clumps, so they must be provided with adequate room to grow. Remove all but the strongest seedling from each pot so it can produce a robust network of roots. Provide light shade and regular, deep watering's during the summer months to prevent heat stress, then slowly acclimate the plant to direct sun in early autumn approximately two weeks before planting them. Meadowsweet plants perform best when planted in consistently moist, mildly alkaline soil, so amend the soil with limestone to increase its pH, if the soil is highly acidic.

•American grown seeds
•Bee Friendly
•Butterfly Friendly
•Hummingbird Friendly
•Deer resistant
•USDA Zones: 2-8

Description:
The Common Milkweed is the plant that most people associate with the word “milkweed”. This is a tall and conspicuous species that sometimes forms large clones. The umbels bear large balls of pink to purplish flowers that have an attractive odor. This familiar wildflower is a significant source of food for monarch caterpillars and butterflies and is used for butterfly gardens and waystations. Plant some today to help counter the increasing threats to the Monarch butterfly. Monarchs lay their eggs exclusively on plants in the Asclepias genus, otherwise known as milkweeds. You're sure to see Monarchs when you plant milkweeds.

Planting Instructions:
In late fall, direct sow just below the surface. Germination will take place in the spring after the last frost. When the seedlings appear, thin to the strongest plant.

•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Bee Friendly
•Butterfly Friendly
•Hummingbird Friendly
•Deer resistant

Description:
A popular native wildflower in western North America, Showy Milkweed commonly occurs on rocky slopes, woodland areas, and streams. The abundant nectar of milkweed flowers attracts hummingbirds, butterflies, honey bees, native bees, and other beneficial insects. Accordingly, this is a wonderful horticultural plant for butterfly gardens, borders, meadows, or native plant landscaping. Milkweed plants are the only larval host for monarch butterflies. It is important to have large, dense clumps of milkweeds for monarch caterpillars. Monarch, queen and viceroy butterflies get chemicals from the milkweed plant that make them distasteful to predators, and all have similar orange and black patterns to warn predators

Medicinal Uses:
The sap of showy milkweed was used by some desert tribes to heal sores and cuts, and to cure warts and ringworm. The ripe seeds were ground and made into a salve for sores. Seeds were boiled and the liquid used to draw the venom from rattlesnake bites. Tea made from the rhizomes was a remedy for measles or coughs. It was also used as a wash to cure rheumatism. The rhizomes, mashed with water, were used as a poultice to reduce swelling. That said, the sap is mildly toxic, so be sure to consult a trained herbalist.

Planting Instructions:
In late fall, direct sow Showy Milkweed seeds just below the surface. Germination will take place in the spring after the last frost. When the seedlings appear, think to the strongest plant per grouping. Seedlings usually do not survive transplanting since the resent any disturbance of their roots. For spring planting, mix the seeds with moist sands and refrigerate for 30 days before direct sowing to break the dormancy of the seeds. Young plants should be watered until they become established. Mature plants can tolerate some drought, but grow best with regular watering. Though not invasive, this plant will eventually spread and form colonies in the wild. It will self seed if left to drop seeds.

"Mint, Common (Mentha spp.) - 100 Seeds","Mint is native to the Mediterranean, but spread into Britain and eventually to America. The Pilgrims brought mint with them on their first journey overseas. While there are a lot of mints: Spearmint, Peppermint, Vietnamese Mint (which isn’t a true mint), Basil Mint, Chocolate Mint and so on... the mint I like best, the one I use most is usually sold under the imaginative name: ‘Mint’ or very occasionally ‘Common Mint’ or ‘Culinary Mint’. Bursting with fragrance and flavor, mint is a versatile herb, adding sprightly, fresh coolness to sweet and savory dishes.

•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Perennial
•USDA Zones: 4-9

Growing Instructions:
Transplant (recommended): Start 6-8 weeks before setting out in early spring; young plants can withstand some freezing. Sow seeds on top of the growing medium, gently pressing them into the soil mix. Do not cover, as the seeds require light to germinate. Keep moist and germinate at a temperature of 55-65°F. Transplant seedlings into individual containers when the first true leaves appear in full sun to partial shade.

Perfect for the cottage garden, this perennial from the mint family has several benefits. Grown from Pennyroyal flower seeds this creeping plant will root from leaf nodes as it spreads. Attractive whorls of lavender flowers appear in mid to late summer, and they appear above the foliage on sturdy stems. The creeping Pennyroyal plant is a useful herb that is highly scented, and has been used to make teas, repel fleas, ants, mice, and other pests and is used in many herbal insect repellents. In addition to the repellents, Pennyroyal herb uses include container plantings such as window boxes and baskets. Pennyroyal ground cover is another use of the plant, and some even use it as a lawn alternative. It is best to confine Mentha Pulegium Pennyroyal as it can be invasive.

HOW TO GROW
Start Pennyroyal flower seeds in late winter or early spring. Pennyroyal seeds require light to germinate, so only lightly cover the flower seeds.

•American grown seeds
•Perennial
•USDA Zones: 1-11

Description:
This attractive plant will fill the air with a spicy scent. The silvery foliage stands out in beautiful contrast in native plantings, as well as being a carefree, bushy ground cover.
Prairie Sage seeds spring up naturally on dry slopes, canyons, open woods, and dry prairies. Its silvery foliage is a food source for animals such as grouse, jackrabbits, antelope, and pronghorn. This plant was one of the most commonly used by Native American tribes, who had numerous medicinal and ceremonial purposes for prairie sage.


Growing Instructions:
Direct sow prairie sage seeds on the surface of the soil in late fall. For spring planting, stratify by mixing the seed with moist sand and storing it in the refrigerator for 30 days before direct sowing. To start indoors after stratifying, sow the seed on the surface of a flat; keep it lightly moist and at a temperature of 65-70 degrees F until germination. Transplant seedlings as soon as they develop a good root system. This plant grows well in poor soil and adapts to rocky, sandy, or clay soils. It tolerates drought well, but does not do well in high humidity. The tops of the stems can be pinched back in spring to tidy the plant's growth; if it begins to decline in summer, the foliage can also be cut back late in the season to promote new growth. When cut in the fall, new growth may appear through the winter. Since this rather aggressive plant both reseeds itself and spreads by means of rhizomes, deadheading the fading flower heads will help prevent excessive new growth. This plant repels deer and rabbits, and helps with erosion control. Its striking silver foliage makes it a good choice for contrast in plantings, and its hardy spread makes it a carefree, bushy ground cover.

White sage (Salvia apiana) is a small evergreen shrub with a rich history of use by Native Americans. This fragrant herb, native to the southwestern United States, is not only valued for its traditional and cultural significance but also adds a unique beauty to your garden with its silvery-green leaves and delicate white flowers. It attracts beneficial insects, providing a valuable food source for native wildlife.

GROWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Start seeds indoors in early spring. Fill a planting tray or small pots with a seed-starting potting mix. Spread seeds on top of the potting medium and mist with water. Place the seed tray or pots in a location that is room temperature. The seeds need a temperature range between 68 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit to germinate. White sage also needs light for germination. Check the seeds regularly for moisture levels and sprouts. Water when the potting mix dries, but avoid making it soggy. Germination should take approximately 14 to 21 days. Transplant seedlings to larger containers when they form true leaves. Keep the plants in a sunny location and water them when the soil dries completely. Allow excess water to drain from the containers.",//southernseeds.com/cdn/shop/files/shopify_-_2024-07-06T105147.431_180x.png?v=1720281203 180w

•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Bee Friendly
•Butterfly Friendly
•Hummingbird Friendly

Description:
Soapwort is a wonderful Old World wildflower that carpets the late spring garden with a multitude of bright pink flowers. A vigorous groundcover, Soapwort readily reseeds itself and naturalizes in the garden. A prompt shearing, as the flowers fade, keeps it tidy and prevents reseeding. A superior ground cover, Soapwort is a particularly good choice for cold, short season areas of the intermountain West. It grows readily in almost any soil including clay. Can tolerate occasional foot traffic

Other uses:
A natural soap can be made by boiling the dried and crushed rhizome (or leaves) for half an hour in water. The saponins present in the plant lower the surface tension of the water resulting in a foamy, soapy solution which can be used for cleaning. This solution is a gentle and effective cleaner that was often used by museums to clean fragile and delicate fabrics that could not withstand the strong chemical soaps.

Planting Instructions:
Soapwort seeds are tiny, so the sowing process is slightly more involved than for larger seeds. Scatter four or five seeds on the surface of the soil with roughly 1/4-inch of space between them. Spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of soil over the seeds, gently tamp it and spray it with water to settle it. Make sure the seeds are completely covered and not exposed to the light because they require darkness to successfully germinate. The seeds are easily dislodged because they are so small, so cover the soil surface with a single layer of coarse perlite or sand to add weight to the soil and help hold them in place.

Since soapwort seeds do not require light for germination, you can position them anywhere indoors without regard for windows or artificial lighting. However, because they require temperatures between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, place them in a warm location, such as atop a refrigerator or on a gas stove with an active pilot light. You may also use an adjustable propagation mat, but it is not strictly necessary. Water the soapwort seeds when the surface of the soil feels mostly dry to the touch. Use a spray bottle to water because its light, diffuse distribution is less likely to dislodge the seeds. Viable soapwort seeds will germinate in roughly 10 to 15 days if kept warm and moist.

Season: Annual
USDA Zones: 3-10
Height: 24 inches
Germination: 14-28 days

•Also known as Bloody Dock or Bloodwort
•Heirloom
•Non-GMO
•American grown seeds
•Perennial
•USDA Zone: 3-7

Description:
Sorrel leaves have a tangy taste, with hints of citrus. They may be harvested as a baby leaf and used in salads, but can also be harvested when mature and cooked like spinach. Sorrel works well as an accompaniment to fish, meat and egg dishes, and as an ingredient in soup and gratins. Leaves may also be added raw to dishes. Red-veined sorrel, Rumex sanguineus, has pointed, bright lime-green leaves with dark red veins. Leaves are best harvested when young and used raw in salads. Sorrel is easy to grow, producing masses of pale green leaves. It’s a hardy perennial so can be treated as a cut-and-come-again crop, and leaves may even be harvested in mid-winter.


Planting Instructions:
Sow sorrel seeds indoors in early spring. Germination takes about 2 weeks. Transplant in mid to late spring. Space plants 12 to 15 inches apart and water generously. This herb grows best in full sun, but a partially shaded environment helps it deal with the heat. Not a beautiful plant and looking a bit weedy, cut back flower stalks to promote new growth. Sorrel does well in a container 6 to 12 inches deep and is ideal to grow as a cool-season annual as the young leaves have the best flavor. Harvest young leaves from established plants and use fresh for the best flavor. The tangy citrus flavor fades as older leaves become bitter, so harvest often to keep new growth coming. Well known for its use in soup, it is also great with fish and vegetables. With its strong yet agreeable flavor, it makes a great secret ingredient to add depth of flavor to salads.

Description:
Alfalfa sprouts were named ""al-fal-fa"" by the Arabs who recognized them as ""the father of all foods."" Alfalfa sprouts are full of vitamins and minerals and are very low in calories. They're versatile, inexpensive and easy to grow, making them an excellent addition to your healthy diet. Alfalfa sprouts are the immature shoots of the alfalfa plant. The mature plant itself isn't used for culinary purposes because the mature leaves are bitter.

Culinary Uses:
They are delicious and nourishing in salads, soups and sandwiches. They are excellent to add texture and crunch to coleslaw. Sprouts are a nice garnish for cream soups. Use it anywhere you would use a radish.

Planting Instructions:
Direct sow red yarrow seeds in fall or early spring; fall planted seed will remain dormant until spring. To start the seeds indoors, plant Achillea Millefolium Rubra seeds just below the surface of the soil since they need light to germinate. Keep the soil temperature at 65-75 degrees F, but out of the hottest rays of sunlight.

This species grows best in sandy or well drained soil, and tolerates drought conditions. Since yarrow tends to flop over in fertile soil or shade, staking may be needed; this also protects the plant's fragile stems in high winds. Deadhead the wilted blossoms often for continued blooming. After the plant has finished blooming, cut the plant down to its lower leaves for healthy spring growth.

Yerba Santa (Eriodictyon californicum) - 30 Seeds,"Yerba santa is Spanish for  “holy herb.” and belonging to the Hydrophyllaceae or Waterleaf family... a family known for its beautiful flowers. Eriodictyon is a Greek compound word meaning “woolly net,” referring to the fuzzy underside of the leaves. The leaves are tough and leathery and often sticky with resin, with alternate arrangement along the stem. The flowers are white to lavender or purple, and shaped somewhat like little trumpets. Used extensively as a medicinal herb, the leaves can be chewed upon for pleasure and for bees who visit the flowers of this plant make a deliciously spicy amber honey.

Planting Instructions:
Yerba santa is a unique plant that tends to grow better after a fire which is why it is known as ""fire follower"". Unlike dormant seeds that need heat or cold to wake up, fire tends to break down the hard seed coating and greatly improves germination. We can mimic this by placing the seeds in an oven set to 190° for 5 minutes. After the treatment, soak the seeds in water for 24 hours and then surface sow on the top of the soil. Keep warm and in sunlight. Water once the soil becomes dry. Germination occurs in 17-60 days.
